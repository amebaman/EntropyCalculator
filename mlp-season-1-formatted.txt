Nightmare Moon.
the Elements of Harmony. Using the magic of the Elements of Harmony, she defeated her younger sister, and banished her permanently in the moon. The elder sister took on responsibility...
Narrator and Twilight Sparkle:...for both sun and moon...
...and harmony has been maintained in Equestria for generations since. Hmm... Elements of Harmony. I know I've heard of those before... but where?


There you are, Twilight! Moondancer is having a little get-together in the west castle courtyard. You wanna come?
Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on.
I know I've heard of the Elements of Harmony.

Ow!
Spike! Spi-ike! Spike?
There you are. Quick, find me that old copy of Predictions and Prophecies. What's that for?
Well, it was a gift for Moondancer, but...
Oh Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing.
But we're on a break!
It's over here!
Mare in the Moon?
Mare in the Moon? But that's just an old ponies' tale.
No-- whoa!
Ow!
Take a note please, to the Princess.
Okie dokie.
My dearest teacher, my continuing studies of pony magic have led me to discover that we are on the precipice of disaster!
Hold on. Preci... preci...
Threshold.
Threh...
Uh, brink? Ugh, that something really bad is about to happen! For you see, the mythical Mare in the Moon is in fact Nightmare Moon, and she's about to return to Equestria, and bring with her eternal night! Something must be done to make sure this terrible prophecy does not come true. I await your quick response. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
Twilight Sparkle. Got it!
Great! Send it.
Now?
Of course!
Uh, I dunno, Twilight, Princess Celestia's a little busy getting ready for the Summer Sun Celebration. And it's like, the day after tomorrow.
That's just it, Spike. The day after tomorrow is the thousandth year of the Summer Sun Celebration! It's imperative that the Princess is told right away!
Impera... impera...
Important!
Whoa!
Oh, I'm not worried, Spike. The Princess trusts me completely. In all the years she's been my mentor she's never once doubted me.
See? I knew she would want to take immediate action.
Mm-hm!
...but you simply must stop reading those dusty old books!

make some friends!
Look on the bright side, Twilight. The Princess arranged for you to stay in a library. Doesn't that make you happy?
Yes, yes it does. You know why? Because I'm right! I'll check on the preparations as fast as I can, then get to the library to find some proof of Nightmare Moon's return.
Then... when will you make friends, like the Princess said?
She said to check on preparations. I am her student, and I'll do my royal duty, but the fate of Equestria does not rest on me making friends.
Thank you, sirs.
Maybe the ponies in Ponyville have interesting things to talk about. Come on, Twilight, just try!
Um... hello?
Well, that was interesting all right.

Sweet Apple Acres.
Yeehaw!
Well, howdy-doo, Miss Twilight, a pleasure makin' your acquaintance. I'm Applejack. We here at Sweet Apple Acres sure do like making new friends!
Friends? Actually, I--
So, what can I do you for?
We sure as sugar are! Would you care to sample some?
As long as it doesn't take too long...
Soup's on, everypony!
Now, why don't I introduce y'all to the Apple family?
Thanks, but I really need to hurry--
Why, I'd say you're already part of the family!
Aren't you gonna stay for brunch?
Sorry, but we have an awful lot to do...
...fine.

Food's all taken care of, next is weather.
Ugh... I ate too much pie...
Hmm, there's supposed to be a Pegasus pony named Rainbow Dash clearing the clouds.
Well, she's not doing a very good job, is she?
Nng.
Nnnn.
Let me guess. You're Rainbow Dash.
The one and only. Why, you heard of me?
Yeah, yeah, that'll be a snap. I'll do it in a jiffy. Just as soon as I'm done practicing.
Practicing for what?
The Wonderbolts! They're gonna perform at the Celebration tomorrow, and I'm gonna show 'em my stuff!
The Wonderbolts?
Yep!
The most talented flyers in all of Equestria?
That's them!
Pfft! Please. They'd never accept a Pegasus who can't even keep the sky clear for one measly day.
Hey, I could clear this sky in ten seconds flat.
Prove it.
Rrgh.
Wait! It's kinda pretty once you get used to it!

Decorations. Beautiful...
Yes, the decor is coming along nicely. This ought'a be quick. I'll be at the library in no time. Beautiful indeed.
Not the decor, her!
No, no, no, oh! Goodness no.
How are my spines? Are they straight?
Good afternoon--
Oh, you mean my mane? Well, it's a long story. I'm just here to check on the decorations, and then I'll be out of your hair!
Out of my hair? What about your hair?!
Wait! Where are we going?! Help!

No, no, uh-uh. Too green. Too yellow. Too poofy. Not poofy enough. Too frilly. Too... shiny. Now go on, my dear. You were telling me where you're from.
Huh?
Canterlot?! Oh, I am so envious! The glamor, the sophistication! I have always dreamed of living there! I can't wait to hear all about it! We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I... Emeralds?! What was I thinking? Let me get you some rubies!
Quick! Before she decides to dye my coat a new color!

Wasn't she wonderful?
Focus, Casanova. What's next on the list?
Oh my. Um, stop please, everyone, umm. Excuse me, sir? I mean, no offense, but your rhythm is just a teeny-tiny bit off. Now, follow me, please. A-one, a-two, a-one two three-
Hello!
I'm sorry, what was that?
Didn't quite catch that.
Oh, I've never seen a baby dragon before. He's sooo cute!
Well, well, well...!
Oh my, he talks. I didn't know dragons could talk. That's just so incredibly wonderful I, I just don't even know what to say!
Well, in that case we'd better be going.
Wait, wait! What's his name?
I'm Spike.
Hi Spike, I'm Fluttershy. Wow, a talking dragon! And what do dragons talk about?
Well, what do you wanna know?
Absolutely everything.
Well... I started out as a cute little purple and green egg...

...and that's the story of my whole entire life! Well, up until today. Do you wanna hear about today?
Oh, yes, please!
Gyah!
I am so sorry, how did we get here so fast? This is where I'm staying while in Ponyville and my poor baby dragon needs his sleep.
No I don't-- whoa!
Aww, wook at dat, he's so sweepy he can't even keep his widdle bawance!
Poor thing, you simply must get into bed...
Yes, yes, we'll get right on that. Well, g'night!
Huh. Rude much?
Sorry, Spike, but I have to convince the Princess that Nightmare Moon is coming, and we're running out of time! I just need to be alone so I can study without a bunch of crazy ponies trying to make friends all the time. Now, where's the light?
Surprise!

Surprise!
Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie, and I threw this party just for you! Were you surprised? Were ya? Were ya? Huh huh huh?
Very surprised. Libraries are supposed to be quiet.
Are you all right, sugarcube?
Aww, she's so happy she's crying!
"Hot sauce". Ooh...

Hey Twilight! Pinkie Pie's starting "pin the tail on the pony"! Wanna play?
No! All the ponies in this town are crazy! Do you know what time it is?!
It's the eve of the Summer Sun Celebration. Everypony has to stay up, or they'll miss the Princess raise the sun! You really should lighten up, Twilight. It's a party!
Ugh, here I thought I'd have time to learn about the Elements of Harmony but, silly me, all this ridiculous friend-making has kept me from it! "Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about everlasting night." I hope the Princess was right... I hope it really is just an old ponytale...
C'mon, Twilight, it's time to watch the sunrise!

Fillies and gentlecolts, as mayor of Ponyville, it is my great pleasure to announce the beginning of the Summer Sun Celebration!
In just a few moments, our town will witness the magic of the sunrise, and celebrate this, the longest day of the year! And now, it is my great honor to introduce to you the ruler of our land, the very pony who gives us the sun and the moon each and every day, the good, the wise, the bringer of harmony to all of Equestria...
Ready?
...Princess Celestia!
Huh?
This can't be good.
Remain calm, everypony, there must be a reasonable explanation!
Ooh, ooh, I love guessing games! Is she hiding?
She's gone!
Oh no... Nightmare Moon!
Oh, my beloved subjects. It's been so long since I've seen your precious, little sun-loving faces.
What did you do with our Princess?!
Does my crown no longer count now that I have been imprisoned for a thousand years? Did you not recall the legend? Did you not see the signs?
I did. And I know who you are. You're the Mare in the Moon – Nightmare Moon!
Well well well, somepony who remembers me. Then you also know why I'm here.



"Elements of Harmony, see "Mare in the Moon"?
But that's just an old ponies' tale.

She will bring about nighttime eternal.

It's imperative that the princess is told right away.

See? I knew she would wanna take immediate action.

My Dear Twilight. There is more to a young pony's life than studying. Make some friends.


All the ponies in this town are crazy!

I hope the Princess was right.

She's gone.

Oh no. Nightmare Moon!



Seize her! Only she knows where the Princess is!
Ergh...

Uh... We gotta stop Nightmare!...
You've been up all night, Spike. You are a baby dragon after all. Elements, elements, elements... Ugh! How can I stop Nightmare Moon without the Elements of Harmony?
And just what are the Elements of Harmony? And how did you know about Nightmare Moon, huh? Are you a spy? Whoa!
Simmer down, Sally. She ain't no spy. But she sure knows what's going on. Don't you, Twilight?
I read all about the prediction of Nightmare Moon. Some mysterious objects called the Elements of Harmony are the only things that can stop her, but I don't know what they are, where to find them; I don't even know what they do!
A Reference Guide."
How did you find that?!
Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Honesty and Loyalty. The sixth is a complete mystery. It is said, the last known location of the five elements was in the ancient castle of the royal pony sisters. It is located in what is now--

The Everfree Forest!
Whee! Let's go!
Not so fast. Look, I appreciate the offer, but I'd really rather do this on my own.
No can do, sugarcube. We sure ain't lettin' any friend of ours go into that creepy place alone. We're stickin' to you like caramel on a candy apple.
Especially if there's candy apples in there. What? Those things are good.

So, none of you have been in here before?
Ugh, Heavens no! Just look at it - it's dreadful.
And it ain't natural. Folk say it don't work the same as Equestria.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nopony knows. You know why?
Rainbow, quit it.
'cause every pony who's ever come in, has never come out!
Fluttershy! Quick!
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.
Hold on! I'm a-comin'!
Applejack! What do I do?
Let go.
Are you crazy?
No I ain't. I promise you'll be safe.
That's not true!
Now listen here. What I'm sayin' to you is the honest truth. Let go, and you'll be safe.
Yaaah! Phew-wah!
Sorry girls. I'm not used to holding anything more than a bunny or two.

And once Pinkie and Rarity were saved, whoosh... Me and Fluttershy loop-de-loop around and WHAM! Caught you right in the nick of time.
We've gotta get past him!
Take that, you ruffian!
My hair! Woop--
Wait.
YEE-HAW! Git along, little dogie.
Wait.
Whoa! All yours, partner.
I'm on it.
Wait!
Rainbow!
WAIT!
Shhh... It's okay. Oh, you poor, poor little baby.
Little?
Now this might hurt for just a second.
Fluttershy!
How did you know about the thorn?
I didn't. Sometimes we all just need to be shown a little kindness.

No. My eyes need a rest from all this icky muck. Well, I didn't mean that literally.
That ancient ruin could be right in front of our faces and we wouldn't even know it.
I didn't see you there, my apologies.
Right here... guh...
Oh wait, I think I stepped in somethin'.
It's just mud.
Aah!

Huh?
Pinkie, what are you doing?! Run!
Oh girls, don't you see?

When I was a little filly and the sun was going down...


Tell me she's not...

The darkness and the shadows, they would always make me frown...


She is.

I'd hide under my pillow
From what I thought I saw
But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way
To deal with fears at all


Then what is?

"Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall
Learn to face your fears
You'll see that they can't hurt you
Just laugh to make them disappear."


Ha! Ha! Ha!



So, giggle at the ghostly
Guffaw at the grossly
Crack up at the creepy
Whoop it up with the weepy
Chortle at the kooky
Snortle at the spooky


And tell that big dumb scary face to take a hike and leave you alone and if he thinks he can scare you then he's got another thing coming and the very idea of such a thing just makes you wanna... hahahaha... heh...


Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuugh!


How are we gonna cross this?
Huh?
Excuse me, sir. Why are you crying?
Oh, give me a break.
That's what all the fuss is about?
Why, of course it is. How can you be so insensitive? Oh, just look at him. Such lovely luminescent scales.
And your expertly coiffed mane.
Oh, I know, I know.
Your fabulous manicure.
All ruined without your beautiful mustache.
It's true, I'm hideous!
I simply cannot let such a crime against fabulosity go uncorrected.
Rarity, what are you-
You look smashing.
Oh, Rarity, your beautiful tail...
Oh. It's fine, my dear. Short tails are in this season. Besides, it'll grow back.
So would the mustache.
Allow me.

There it is, the ruin that holds The Elements of Harmony. We made it!
Twilight, wait for us!
We're almost there. Whoa!
What's with you and falling off cliffs today?
Duh.
Oh yeah.
Rainbow...
Who's there?
Rainbow...
I ain't scared of you! Show yourself!
We've been eagerly awaiting the arrival of the best flyer in Equestria.
Who?
Why, you, of course.
Really?! I mean... Oh yeah, me. Hey, uh, you wouldn't mind telling the Wonderbolts that, would ya? 'cause I've been trying to get into that group for like, ever.
No, Rainbow Dash. We want you to join us, The Shadowbolts. We're the greatest aerial team in the Everfree Forest, and soon we will be the greatest in all Equestria, but first, we need a captain. The most magnificent-
Yep.
Swiftest-
Yes.
Bravest flyer in all the land.
We need... you.
WOOHOO! Sign me up. Just let me tie this bridge real quick and then we have a deal.
No! It's them or us.
Rainbow, what's taking so long? Oh no. Rainbow! Don't listen to them.
Well?
You... Thank you! For the offer, I mean, but I'm afraid I have to say no.
See? I'd never leave my friends hangin'.

Whoa. Come on, Twilight. Isn't this what you've been waitin' for?
The Elements of Harmony, we've found them. Careful, careful!
One, two, three, four... There's only five!
Where's the sixth?
when the five are present, a spark will cause the sixth Element to be revealed.
What in the hay is that supposed to mean?
I'm not sure, but I have an idea. Stand back. I don't know what will happen.
Come on now, y'all. She needs to concentrate.
Aah!
Twilight!
The Elements!

Twilight, where are you?
Look!
Come on!
You're kidding. You're kidding, right?
No, no!
What?
Applejack, who reassured me when I was in doubt, represents the spirit of... honesty!
Fluttershy, who tamed the manticore with her compassion, represents the spirit of... kindness!
Pinkie Pie, who banished fear by giggling in the face of danger, represents the spirit of... laughter!
Rarity, who calmed a sorrowful serpent with a meaningful gift represents the spirit of... generosity!
And Rainbow Dash, who could not abandon her friends for her own heart's desire represents the spirit of... loyalty!
The spirits of these five ponies got us through every challenge you threw at us.
You still don't have the sixth Element! The spark didn't work!
the element of... magic!
Nooo! Nooo!

Ugh, my head.
Everypony okay?
Oh, thank goodness.
Why Rarity, it's so lovely.
I know! I'll never part with it again.
No. Your necklace. It looks just like your cutie mark.
What? Ooh. So does yours.
Look at mine! Look at mine!
Aw yeah.
Gee, Twilight! I thought you were just spoutin' a lot of hooey, but I reckon we really do represent the elements of friendship.
Indeed you do.
Twilight Sparkle, my faithful student. I knew you could do it.
But... you told me it was all an old pony tale.
I told you that you needed to make some friends, nothing more. I saw the signs of Nightmare Moon's return and I knew it was you who had the magic inside to defeat her, but you could not unleash it until you let true friendship into your heart. Now if only another will as well. Princess Luna!
It has been a thousand years since I have seen you like this. Time to put our differences behind us. We were meant to rule together, little sister.
Sister?
Will you accept my friendship?
Whoa!
I'm so sorry! I missed you so much, big sister!
I've missed you, too.

A party!
Why so glum, my faithful student? Are you not happy that your quest is complete and you can return to your studies in Canterlot?
That's just it. Just when I learned how wonderful it is to have friends, I have to leave them.
Spike, take a note, please. I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall take on a new mission for Equestria. She must continue to study the magic of friendship. She must report to me her findings from her new home in Ponyville.
Oh thank you, Princess Celestia! I'll study harder than ever before.



No. Nope. Nope--
No problem at all, Applejack. I'm glad the goal is lunchtime. All this hard work is making me hungry.
I know, right?
Puh-leez, Spike, you've been lounging on my back all morning while we worked.
Exactly. You two are taking so long, I missed snack-time.
Nope. Worm. A-ha!
Oh Spike, that looks delicious. 
Spike.
It's a letter from Princess Celestia.


Woo-hoo!
Wow, great! I've never been to the gala. Have you, Spike?
No, and I plan to keep it that way. I don't want any of that girly frilly frou-frou nonsense.
Aw, come on Spike. A dance would be nice.
Nice? It's a heap good more than just nice. I'd love to go. Land sakes, if I had an apple stand set up, ponies would be chowin' our tasty vittles till the cows came home. Do you have any idea how much business I could drum up for Sweet Apple Acres? Why, with all that money, we could do a heap of fixin' up 'round here. We could replace that saggy old roof, and Big McIntosh could replace that saggy old plow, and Granny Smith could replace that saggy old hip.

Why, I'd give my left hind leg to go to that gala.
Oh, well in that case, would you like to--
Rainbow Dash, you told me you were too busy to help me harvest apples. What were you busy doing, spyin'?
No, I was busy napping, and I just happened to hear that you have an extra ticket?
Yeah, but--
YES! This is so awesome. The Wonderbolts perform at The Grand Galloping Gala every year. I can see it now. Everyone would be watching the sky. Their eyes riveted on The Wonderbolts, but then in would fly Rainbow Dash!
I would draw their attention with my Super Speed Strut.
Then, I would mesmerize 'em with my Fantastic Filly Flash. And for my grand finale, The Buccaneer Blaze! The ponies would go wild!
The Wonderbolts would insist that my signature moves be incorporated into their routine, and then welcome me as their newest member.

So? That doesn't mean you own it.
Girls, these are my tickets, I'll decide who gets it, thank you very much. Whoever has the best reason to go should get the ticket, don't you think?
Drummin' up business for the farm?
A chance to audition for The Wonderbolts?
Money t' fix granny's hip.
Living the dream.
Okay.

So, who you gonna give the ticket to, Twilight?
I don't know Spike, but I really can't think straight when I'm hungry, so where should we eat?

Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
Hip hip
Hooray!
It's the best place for me
For Pinkie...


With decorations like streamers and fairy-lights and pinwheels and piñatas and pin-cushions. With goodies like sugar cubes and sugar canes and sundaes and sun-beams and sarsaparilla. And I get to play my favorite-est of favorite fantabulous games like Pin the Tail on the Pony!

Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
'Cause it's the most galarrific superly-terrific gala ever
In the whole galaxy
Wheee!!

Oh thank you, Twilight, it's the most wonderful-est gift ever.
Um, actually--
Uh--
Yes, yes, yes! Twilight's taking me to The Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot.
The gala? I design ensembles for the gala every year, but I've never had the opportunity to attend. Oh, the society, the culture, the glamour! It's where I truly belong, and where I'm destined to meet him.
Him! ...Who?

Twilight, I simply cannot believe you would invite Pinkie Pie so she can... party, and prevent me from meeting my true love. How could you? Hmph.
Hey!
Uh, listen guys, I haven't decided who to give the extra ticket to.
You haven't?
Um, excuse me, Twilight. I would just like to ask, I mean, if it would be all right, if you haven't given it to someone else--
You? You want to go to the gala?
Oh, no. I mean, yes, or, actually, kind of. You see, it's not so much The Grand Galloping Gala as it is the wondrous private gated garden that surrounds the dance. The flowers are said to be the most beautiful and fragrant in all of Equestria. For the night of the gala, and that night alone, would they all be in bloom... and that's just the flora! Don't get me started on the fauna. There's loons and toucans and bitterns, oh my! Hummingbirds that can really hum, and buzzards that can really buzz. White-blue jays, and red jays, and green jays, pink jays and pink flamingos!

Gee, Fluttershy, it sounds... beautiful?
Wait just a minute.
Rainbow Dash, were you following me?
No. I mean, yes. I mean, maybe. Look, it doesn't matter. I couldn't risk a goody-four-shoes like you giving that ticket away to just anybody.
Wait just another minute.
Applejack, were you following me too?
No. I was followin' this one to make sure she didn't try any funny business. Still trying to take mah ticket.
Your ticket?
But Twilight's taking me.

QUIET!
And then I said, "Oatmeal, are you craz--" oh.
Girls, there's no use in arguing.
But Twilight-
And don't worry, I'll figure this out... somehow.

Have you made your decision?
I CAN'T DECIDE!
Twilight, he just wants to take your order.
Oh. I would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich.
Do you have any rubies? No? Okay. I'll have the hay fries, extra crispy.
What do you think, Spike?
I think we have to try another restaurant. I mean, I like grass just fine, but would it hurt anybody to offer some gemstones?
I mean about the gala and the ticket and who I should take.
Oh. You're still on that?
Spike, listen. How do I choose? And when I do choose, will the other four be mad at me? I mean, I could give up my ticket and give away two, but that would still leave three disappointed ponies. What if I--
Ah, your food.
Oh thank you. This looks so good. I'm sure everything will be much clearer once I eat.
Em, madam? Are you going to eat your food in ze rain?
It's not raining. What's going on?
Hi there, best friend forever I've ever ever had. Enjoying the sunny weather?
Rainbow Dash, what are you doing?
Whaddya you mean? I just saw the smartest, most generous pony about to get rained on, so I thought I'd kick a hole in the clouds to keep her dry so she could dine in peace, that's all.
Rainbow, you're not trying to get extra consideration for the extra ticket by doing me extra special favors, are you?
Me? No no no, of course not.
Uh-huh.
Seriously, I'd do it for any pony. Heh heh, eh.
Rainbow, I am not comfortable accepting unwanted favors, so I'd appreciate it if you close up that rain cloud right now.
Twilight, it's raining.
No, really?
Come with me before you catch a cold.

Heh heh, oops, sorry.
Oh no, it's quite all right. After all, we are... the best of friends, are we not? And you know what the best of friends do?
Uh...
Makeovers!
Ugh, Rarity, ow, this really isn't fixing it. I mean, thank you but, ooh, that's too tight.
There. Oh, you're simply darling.
Uh, yeah, it is kinda pretty, isn't it?
And you. Oh Spike, I have a dandy little outfit for the dashing gent.
D-ah, ow, oh, hey, wow, watch it, whoa!
Now you just need a hat.
Ugh, I told you, I don't want any part of this girly gala gunk, see you back at the library.
Wait, The Grand--
I see what's going on. You're just buttering me up so I give you the extra ticket. Well it's not gonna work. You're going to have to wait for my decision just like everyone else. Now if you'll excuse me, I've been trying all day just to get some lunch.
Did somepony say lunch?
You've got to be kidding me!
I got apple pie, apple fritters, apple tarts, apple dumplings, apple crisps, apple crumblers, and apple Brown Betty. Uh, the dessert, not my auntie. What do you say there, best friend?
Is that a yes?
No. No. I don't know who I'm giving the ticket to, and all these favors aren't making it any easier to decide. In fact, I'm less sure now than I was this morning. Ugh!
So, that's a maybe?

Ugh, I never thought being showered with favors would be so aggravating.
Oh, well, hello Twilight. I hope you don't mind, but we're all doing a little spring cleaning for you.
It's summer.
Oh, well, better late than never, right? It was Angel's idea.
You're not doing this for the ticket, are you?
Oh no, I'm doing this because you're my very best friend. Right Angel? Oh, yes, we are just doing this for the ticket.
No, no, no! Well, this was all very nice of you and Angel, but I'm not accepting any extra favors until I've made my final decision, so I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
SURPRISE!

Twilight is my bestest friend
Whoopie, whoopie!


Pinkie...

She's the cutest, smartest, all around best pony, pony!


Pinkie.

I bet if I throw a super-duper fun party, party!


Pinkie!

She'll give her extra ticket to the Gala to me!


PIIINKIIIE!!
Yes, Twilight?
At least the other ponies tried to be subtle about the ticket.
Wait, what ticket? What gala?
Oh, you didn't know? Twilight has an extra ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala!
The Grand Galloping Gala?
Would you like any help with your gardening?
I have a cartload of extra carrots.
What are we gonna do?
We're... gonna... run!
Ugh, warn me next time you're gonna do that.
I didn't even know it was gonna happen. Now quick, lock the doors. Yaaaargh! I can't decide, I just can't decide. It's important to all of you and I just can't stand to disappoint any of you, and giving me gifts and doing me favors won't make any difference, because you're all my friends and I wanna make you all happy and I can't, I just can't!
Twilight, sugar, I didn't mean to put so much pressure on you, and if it helps, I don't want the ticket anymore. You can give it to somepony else. I won't feel bad, I promise.
Me too. I feel just awful that I made you feel so awful.
And me too. It's no fun upsetting your friends.
Twilight, it was unfair of me to try to force you as I did.
We all got so gun-ho about going to the gala that we couldn't see how un-gun-ho we were making you.
We're sorry, Twilight.
Spike, take down a note. Dear Princess Celestia,
I've learned that one of the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings, but when there's not enough blessings to go around, having more than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. So, though I appreciate the invitation, I will be returning both tickets to The Grand Galloping Gala.
What?!
If my friends can't all go, I don't wanna go either.
Twilight, you don't have to do that.
Nope. I've made up my mind. Spike, you can send the letter now.
Now you won't get to go to the gala either.
It's okay, girls. I couldn't possibly enjoy myself without my best friends there with me, so I would rather not go at all.
Hgh... hgh... urk... urk...
Well wallop my withers, Spike. Isn't that just like a boy? Can't handle the least bit of sentiment.
Whoa Nelly!
A letter from the princess? That was fast.
"My faithful student Twilight,
Why didn't you just say so in the first place?" Six tickets to The Grand Galloping Gala.
Now we can all go.
Allow us to treat you to dinner.
What a great way to apologize.
And to celebrate. Come on everyone, the cupcakes are on me.


Boy howdy! I got my work cut out for me. That there is the biggest bumper crop o' apples I ever laid eyes on.
Eeyup. Too big for you to handle on your own.
Come on, big brother! You need to rest up and get yourself better. I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle. Oops, sorry. I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end.
Biting off more than you can chew is just what I'm afraid of.
Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?
Eeyup.
Why of all the... This is your sister Applejack, remember? The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies?
But still only one pony, and one pony plus hundreds o' apple trees just doesn't add up to...


Well I better get kickin'. These apples aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees. Hey! Oh no.

STAMPEDE!
Stampede!
Pinkie Pie, are you crazy?! Run!
Everypony calm down. There is no need to panic.
But Mayor, whatever shall we do?
Look there!
YEEHAW!
Move aside, Winona. Put 'em up, girl!
This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen.
Whoaaa. Hooie. Now what was that all about?
And it just gave us all the willies, don'tcha know.
I completely understand. Just next time, try and steer clear of Ponyville.
We certainly will, Applejack. So long, Winona!
Yee haw!
Yee haw! Ride 'em, cowpony!
Applejack was just... just...
Appletastic!
Exactly. We must do something to thank Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town.
I know.

A party!
We all ready?
Just one last thing. Now we're ready.
Is Applejack all set?
Actually, I haven't seen her all week.
Not since the stampede.
But she'll be here for sure. Applejack is never late.

Welcome, everypony! Today we are here to honor a pony we can always count on to help in matters great and small. A pony whose contributions to--
Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there? What an athlete. This week she's gonna help me with my new flying trick, and I know it's gonna be so awesome.
Exactly. And...
This week, I get to run Sugarcube Corner for the first time.
What does that have to do with Applejack?
Oh. Applejack, one of the best bakers ever, is gonna help me. Applejack makes everything great, so free samples for everypony!
Oh-kay, that's great. Now if I could just make a point without being inter--
Twilight?
--rupted.
Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also helping me this week with the official bunny census, where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season. She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills.
Anyone else? Anyone? No? Well then, as I was trying to say... Urgh! Never mind.
Applejack!
Cool! Way to go Applejack, that was awesome! I mean-- heh.
Ah-ahem.
Awkward.
Woo-ooo.
Ooo-ooo.
Okay. Well, thank you Applejack for saving us from that scary stampede, and always being there for everypony.
Was it just me, or did Applejack seem a little--
Tired?
Dizzy?
Messy? Well, did you see her mane?
She seemed fine to me. Woo! Woo!
Hmm.

What on Earth is that pony doing?
Whoops.
Hey Applejack!
Applejack.
Applejack. AppleJACK!
Oh, howdy, Twilight.
What is all this?
It's Applebuck season. Whoa.
Applewhat season?
Neh, It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time. We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em.
But why are you doing it all alone?
'cause Big McIntosh hurt himself.
What about all those relatives I've met when I first came to Ponyville? Can't they help?
Fine.
Could you step aside, Twilight?
I just did. Applejack, you don't look so good.
Eh, don't any of you three worry none, I'm just fine and dandy. Whoa.
Do you... want some help?
Help? No way, no how.
But there's no way you can do it all on your own.
Is that a challenge?
Uhm... no?
Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it! Now if you'll excuse me, I've got apples to buck.

There you are.
See this contraption?
Uh... Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then you're gonna jump down from that platform, launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own. Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some amazing flips and spins that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.
Isn't that a might' dangerous?
Pfft, Heh, not for a pony who can fly.
Well, all right-y then. Oh my.
Ready? One... two... THREE!
Umm... maybe I wasn't clear. You're supposed to land on the other end.
Applejack, what the hay is going on? I mean, I thought I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!
Ugh!
Heh heh... Here I go!
Wait, Applejaaaaack!
You're welcome!

Can I help you?
I think somepony else needs your help.
Applejack?
Yep.

Ow!
Applejack, can we talk? Applejack, can we talk?
Can bees squawk?! I don't think so.
No. Can we talk?
Twenty stalks? Bean or celery?
No! I need to talk to you.
You need to walk to the zoo? Well, who's stoppin' you?
I need to talk to you!
Oh! Well why didn't you say so? What you wanna talk about?
Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today.
That's quite neighborly of her.
Yes, except that she crashed onto my balcony after you launched her into the air.
Oh, yeah. I wasn't feeling quite myself this morning.
Because you're working too hard and you need help.
What? Kelp? I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed.
HELP! You need HELP!
Nothin' doin', Twilight. I'm gonna prove to you, t'everypony, that I can do this on my own. Ow! Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie.
Ugh.

Now Pinkie Pie, are you sure you're up for baking the muffins and running the store this afternoon?
Yes siree bob, Mrs Cake. Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out. Why, she's the best baker ever. Right, Applejack?
No? You're not the best baker ever?
WHAT? Oh no! I mean, don't you fret. I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.
Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'.

All right-y! I'll get the sugar and the eggs. Can you get me some chocolate chips?
Eh, uh, whu, what was that?
Chocolate chips.
Chips... got it. Tater chips, a little salty and dry, okie-dokie. What next?
Baking soda.
Soda. Perfect. That'll get the tater chips nice and wet. Now what?
A cup of flour.
A cup o' sour? Well, lemons are sure sour. One cup o' sour, comin' up. Anything else, Pinkie?
One last thing. Wheat germ.
Wheat worms? Oh, that must be fancy talk for earthworms.
Now that's gonna be delicious.
If you say so.

Free muffin sample spectacular!
Yeah! Muffin spectacles! Get 'em while they're hot.

We came as soon as we heard.
Oh thank you, Twilight. We need all the help we can get.
Oh no! What happened?
It was a mishap with some of the baked goods.
Applejack.

Applejack, we need to talk.
Not to upset your applecart, but you need help.
Here, let me help.
AJ, think you're beating a dead... tree.
I knew that.
Actually, Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about. I just came back from Ponyville Urgent Care and--
You know, I'm a little busy to get lectured right now, Twilight.
But if you'd just let me help--
Ugh. No, no, NO! How many times do I gotta say it? I don't need no help from nopony!
Ugh. That pony is stubborn as a mule.
No offense.
None taken.

Oh Applejack! Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit round up.
Ugh. Why are we doin' this?
Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born, so it's my job to get a count of all the new families.
Fine. Can we just get on with it?
Certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows. They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently.
I do NOT need any direction on corrallin' critters. Right, Winona?
Okay, little bunnies! I need you to all gather here in the middle.
That's right! Let's go, bunnies. In the center. Hop to it. Swell. Just swell. Put 'em up, Winona!
Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them.
We know what we're doin'. Get along, little bunnies.
Oh no.

STAMPEDE!

The horror, the horror.
It was awful.
A disaster. A horrible, horrible disaster.
I don't get it.
Our gardens, destroyed.
Every last flower, devoured.
By... by... THEM!
Oh my. Oh... Please stop, little bunnies. Oh no! Please, let's go home. Oh my goodness.
All right. Enough is enough.

All right, Applejack. Your applebucking hasn't just caused you problems, it's over-propelled Pegasus', practically poisoned plenty of ponies, and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies. I don't care what you say, you. Need. Help.
Um, how do you like them apples?

Applejack. Applejack.
Huh?
Oh, good, you're okay. Now Applejack, I completely respect the Apple family ways. You're always there to help any pony in need, so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside and allow your friends to help you.
Okay, Twilight.
I am not taking "no" for an answer--what?
Yes, Twilight. Yes, please. I could really use your help.

Dear Princess Celestia,
My friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have, and she's always there to help any pony. The only trouble is, when she needs help, she finds it hard to accept it, so while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends, it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer.

Your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle

A bit?
Okay. A mite stubborn, and I'm awful sorry. Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony award, but the real award is having you five as my friends.
Phew! That applebucking sure made me hungry.
And I've got the perfect treat.
Eeew... Spike, I threw those all away. Where'd you get them?
From the trash.
Just a little nibble? Come on.
Ew! Gross!


Hoof-biting action overload! She was like a stunt superstar, flying higher and higher, and then Rainbow Dash swooped down--swoosh--and right before she hit the ground--shoom-she pulled up--vrrrmmm!
Uh-huh.
And then she looped around and around like whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo!
Uh-huh. Phew.
Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash.
Not now, Pinkie Pie.
But, but Rainbow Dash–
I'm in the middle of something.
But–
I was gonna tell you to look out for that mountain.


Isn't she right up there?
Rainbow Dash.

Phew. That was close.
Hi!
Aah!

Hi again.
Aah!

Pfeh. I need a favor, Rainbow Dash.
Waaa--oh, forget it.
I totally promise it'll be totally fun.

Over to the right. No no, a little to the left. Oh wait, back to the right. Now a little leftish while staying rightly. Stop. Hmm. Maybe a few inches to the south. Now a couple centimeters north. Okay. One more smidgimeter to the--
Pinkie Pie!
Uh, I mean, perfect. Now wait for my signal.
Oh no, you're not hurt are you?
Oh, okay, good.
I can think of one thing.
I didn't take you for a prankster, Pinkie Pie.
You know Pinkie Pie, you're not as annoying as I thought.
You wanna hang out?
A simple nod would do.
Mmm-hmm.

Is she even home?
I don't know. This is gonna be gold.
There she is.
Aaa-choo!

Hmm?


Is someone over there? Who're we gonna squirt? Who're we gonna squirt?
Oh, awesome. Who? Who? Do I know them?
Ridiculous.

Mornin', Pinks. Gilda, this is my gal pal, Pinkie Pie.
Hey. What's up?
Pinkie, this is my griffon friend, Gilda.
What's a griffon?
She's half-eagle, half-lion.
And all awesome. Raa. Heh-haa. Yeah, that's right.
Gilda's my best friend from my days at Junior Speedster flight camp. Hey, remember the chant?
Sha, they made us recite it every morning, I'll never get that lame thing out of my head.
Sooo...
Ugh. Only for you, Dash.
Junior Speedsters are our lives,
Sky-bound soars and daring dives
Junior Speedsters, it's our quest,
To some day be the very best!

Huh. Well, I groove on a good prank as much as the next griffon. But Dash, you promised me we'd get a flying session in this morning.
Yeah, uh, well, Pinkie Pie, you don't mind, do you? Gilda just got here. We'll catch up with you later.

Whoa, that was sweet. Just like old times.
Yeah, only faster. So now what?
Hey there.
Huh?
It's later. And I caught up.
Pinkie Pie, you are so random.
Hey Dash, think you got enough gas left to beat me to that cloud?
A race? You are so on.
One, two, three, go.
Hey!
I win.
As if. I won, dude.
No way.
Yes way.
Oh, come on, I was way ahead of you.
Uh, I don't think so.
Oh Geez, dream on.
Remember back in camp? I–
There is no way you beat me.
Whatever.
Wow guys, that was really close, but I think Rainbow Dash beat you by a teeny weeny itty bitty hair, or a teeny weeny itty bitty feather.
Hah, see? Good thing Pinkie Pie's here to keep you honest, G.
Wait, guys! Oh wow, you guys almost got away from me that time.
So, Dash, got any new moves in your tricktionary, or are you 100% old school?
New moves? Heh, sit back G, this is gonna take a while.
Hey Pinkie, c'mere.
Yeah?
Don't you know how to take get lost for an answer? Dash doesn't need to hang with a dweeb like you now that I'm around. You're dorkin' up the skies, Stinkie Pie, so make like a bee and BUZZ OFF.
Try matching that. Hey, where's Pinkie Pie and her crazy contraption?
Eh, she left. Something about being as busy as a bee.
Hmph!

So Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean?
Um, yeah. She keeps stealing Rainbow Dash away, she pops my balloons, and she told me to buzz off. I've never met a griffon this mean. Well, actually, I've never met a griffon at all, but I bet if I had, she wouldn't have been as mean and grumpy as Gilda.
You know what I think, Pinkie Pie.
Hmm?
Well, I think... you're jealous.
Jealous?
Green with envy. Well, in your case, pink with envy.
Well, yes. Jealous. Listen Pinkie, I don't want to upset you, but just because Rainbow Dash has another friend doesn't make Gilda a grump. I mean, perhaps it's you, Pinkie, who needs to improve her attitude.


Ugh, I gotta take care of a few weather jobs around here. Shouldn't take long. Just, uh, hang out in town and I'll come find ya.
That's cool, I guess. I'm gonna go chow down.
Later.
This stuff ain't fresh, dude.
Aw, poor Granny Smith, she didn't know it was a joke. How mean. No, no, I can't misjudge her. It was kind of a funny prank, I guess.
Alright little ones, this way, this way. Mama duck, you're free and clear.
Hey.
Please excuse me.
I'm walkin' here.
Oh, um, I'm sorry. I-I-I was just trying to...
B-b-b-but I... I...
Ugh, please, all these lame ponies are driving me buggy. I gotta bail.
She's a grump, and a thief, and a bully. The meanest kind of mean meanie-pants there is. I can take it, but no one treats Fluttershy like that. No. One. This calls for extreme measures, Pinkie Pie style.

Welcome, welcome. Welcome!
Who's this Gilda I've heard nothing about?
I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash. A griffon, so rare.
You've met Gilda, right? What's she like?
Oh, um, well, I'll tell you later, Twilight.
Welcome. Welcome.
Um, Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda. Umm... Do you really think it's a good idea? I mean–
Don't worry your pretty little head about mean old Gilda. Your auntie Pinkie Pie's got it all taken care of.
I'm a year older than you.
Gilda! I'm so honored to throw you one of my signature Pinkie Pie parties, and I really, truly, sincerely, hope you feel welcome here amongst all us pony folk.
Oh Pinkie Pie, the old hoof-shake buzzer. You are a scream.
Come on G, I'll introduce you to some of my other friends.
Right behind you Dash. I know what you're up to.
Great.
Rrrh. I know what you're planning.
I mean, I've got my eye on you.
And I got my eye on you. Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda, a long-time, dear friend of Rainbow Dash. Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville.
Please help yourself.
Vanilla lemon drops. Don't mind if I do. HOT!
G, the punch.
Well, whaddya know, pepper in the vanilla lemon drops, and the punch served in a dribble glass.
Hey G, look, presents.
Spittin' snakes. Hah, somepony pulled that prank on me last month.
Ha ha. I bet I know who that was.
You do?

Cake time everypony.
Hey, can I blow out the candles?
Why don't we let Gilda blow out the candles, Spike. She is the guest of honor after all.
Ugh.
Now, I wonder who could've done that.
Yeah, I wonder.
Mmm, who cares. This cake is amazing.
Spike.
What? It's great, try some.
Hey G, you're not upset about some silly candles, are you?
No way Dash, like I said, I'm down with a good prank.
Come on then, let's have some cake.
Hey, I'm watching you. Like a hawk.
Why? Can't you watch me like a griffon?
Hey y'all, it's pin the tail on the pony. Let's play.
Oh, my favorite game. Can I go first? Can I have the purple tail?
Well, I am the guest of honor, and I'll have the purple tail.
Yeah, Gilda should definitely go first. Let's get you blindfolded.
Hey what-- ugh-- what are you doing? Rrrah.
We're spinning you around and around and then you can pin the tail on the pony. Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail.
Wait. The poster is this--
Uh, Gilda? You pinned the tail on the wrong end.
You know Gilda, I was the one who set up all those weak pranks at this party.
Ooh.
So I guess I'm queen lame-o.
Come on, Dash, you're joshing me.
They weren't all meant for you specifically, it was just dumb luck that you set them all off.
I shoulda known, that dribble cup had Rainbow Dash written all over it.
No way. It was Pinkie Pie, she set up this party to trip me up, to make a fool of me.
Me? I threw this party to improve your attitude. I thought a good party might turn that frown upside down.
And you sure didn't need any help making a fool of yourself. You know, this is not how I thought my old friends would treat my new friends. If being cool is all you care about, maybe you should go find some new cool friends someplace else.
Not cool.
Wow, talk about a party pooper.
Wow, what was that about?
Um, what just happened?
Really awkward.
I'm sorry everypony, for bringing Gilda here. I didn't know how rude she was. And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined that awesome party you put on for her.
Hey, if you want to hang out with party poopers, that's your business.
I'd rather hang out with you. No hard feelings?
No hard feelings.
Hey Pinkie. Sorry I accused you of misjudging Gilda. Looks likes I'm the one who misjudged you.
It's okay Twilight, even you can't be a super smart smarty smart-pants all the time. Come on everypony, there's still a whole lotta party to finish.

Dearest Princess Celestia,
Today I learned that it's hard to accept when somepony you like wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice. Though it's impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to control your own behavior. Just continue to be a good friend. In the end, the difference between a false friend and the one who is true will surely come to light.

Your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle

Dear Twilight Sparkle,


Come on, Twilight, you can do it!
Okay, here goes.
Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you look, it's just for practice, and it's gotta go.
Wait! Aw, rats.


Twenty-five, Twilight. Twenty-five different kinds of tricks and counting. I thought unicorns were only supposed to have a little magic that matches their special talents!
True, for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math. But what if a unicorn's special talent is magic?
Like you, Twilight, and you know a ton of magic.
Oh, Spike, stop. I'm sure there are lots of ponies right here in Ponyville that know just as much magic as me.
Are you kiddin'? I don't think there's another unicorn in all of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight.
Gangway! Comin' through!
Augh! Snips, Snails! What's goin' on?
Wha, haven't you heard?
Whoa!
There's a new unicorn in town!
Yeah! They say that she's got more magical powers than any other unicorn ever!
Really?
Aw, no way, that honor goes to Twilight here.
Where is this unicorn?
Ho, she's in the town square. Come on!

Come one, come all! Come and witness the amazing magic of the Great and Powerful Trixie!
Ooh!
Watch in awe as the Great and Powerful Trixie performs the most spectacular feats of magic ever witnessed by pony eyes!
My, my, my! What boasting!
There's nothing wrong with being talented, is there?
Nothin' at all, 'cept in when someone goes around showin' it off like a school filly with fancy new ribbons.
Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us.
Well, well, well, it seems we have some neighsayers in the audience. Who is so ignorant as to challenge the magical ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie? Do they not know that they're in the presence of the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria?
Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is—
Spike! Shhh!
What? What's wrong?
You see the way they reacted to Trixie? I don't want anyone thinking I'm a show-off.
So, "Great and Powerful Trixie". What makes you think you're so awesome, anyway?
Heh, why, only the Great and Powerful Trixie has magic strong enough to vanquish the dreaded ursa major!
Ahh!
What?
No way!
When all hope was lost, the ponies of Hoofington had no one to turn to, but the Great and Powerful Trixie stepped in, and with her awesome magic, vanquished the ursa major and sent it back to its cave deep within the Everfree Forest!
Saw, sweet!
That settles it.
Trixie truly is the most talented, the most magical, the most awesome unicorn in Ponyville.
No, in all of Equestria!
There's no way I'm going to use my magic now, Spike. Especially since—
Hmm, how about you!

Well, how about it? Hm? Is there anything you can do that the Great and Powerful Trixie can't?
I— I—
Well, little hayseed?
That's it! I can't stand for no more of this!
You show her, AJ!
Can your magical powers do this?
Top that, missy.
Oh ye of little talent. Watch and be amazed at the magic of Trixie!
Whoa! Uh!
Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie prevails.
There's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that.
Oh?
That's my job!
They don't call me "Rainbow" and "Dash" for nothin'!
When Trixie is through, the only thing they'll call you is loser.
Seems like any pony with a dash of good sense would think twice before tussling with the Great Trixie.
Ow!
What we need is another unicorn to challenge her. Someone with some magic of her own.
Yeah! A unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss.
A real unicorn to unicorn tussle.
Uh...
Enough. Enough, all of you. I take your hint, but Rarity is above such nonsense. Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace.
Ooo, what's the matter? Afraid you'll get a hair out of place in that rat's nest you call a mane?
Oh, it. Is. On! You may think you're tough with all of your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your brutish ways. A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle. A unicorn needs to have style.
Ooh!
A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty.
Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her! She's strong, she's beautiful, she's—
Quick! I need a mirror! Get me a mirror! What did she do to my hair? I know she did something terrible to my hair!
Nothing.
It's fine.
It's gorgeous.
It's green. What?
Well, I never!
Well Twilight, guess it's up to you. Come on, show her what you're made of.
What do you mean? I'm nothing special.
Yes, you are! You're better than her!
I'm not better than anyone.
Hah! You think you're better than the Great and Powerful Trixie? You think you have more magical talent? Well, come on, show Trixie what you've got. Show us all.
Who, me? I'm just your run-of-the-mill citizen of Ponyville. No powerful magic here. I, uh... I think I hear my laundry calling. Sorry, gotta go.
Twilight?
Ha! Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie has proven herself to be the most amazing unicorn in all of Equestria. Huh, was there ever any doubt?

Here's your smoothie you asked for, with extra hay, just how you like it.
Mmm, hay.
Ooo, tell us another story Great and Powerful Trixie.
Yeah, tell us about how you vanquished the ursa major.
Guh! Trixie is far too exhausted from performing feats beyond imagination. Begone with you until morning.
Oh, of course, Great and Powerful Trixie.
Anything you say. We are at your beck and call.
Ah.
What are you two doin'?
Just bringin' the Gee an' Pee Tee a—
The what?
The Great and Powerful Trixie.
Sheesh.
Just bringin' her a smoothie.
How can you fall for her lameness? She's just a show-off. Unlike Twilight, who—
The Great and Powerful Trixie vanquished an ursa major. Can your Twilight claim that?
Oh really? Were you guys actually there?
Well, eh, uh... no, but—
But nothin'. The proof is in the pudding.
Look, unless an ursa major comes waltzing up the street for Trixie to vanquish, I am not gonna believe a word she says, and neither should you!
Hm, an ursa walkin' up the street, hey? Snails! Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Why is it they call it a flea market when they don't really sell fleas?
Yeah, uh... oh, come on!

Twilight, would you put down that book and just listen to me?
Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's bragging, Spike? If I go out there and show off my magic, I run the risk of losing them as friends.
It's not the same thing, Twilight. You'll be using your magic to stand up for your friends!
No, Spike, it's exactly the same.
Come on, Twilight, any one of these tricks, even the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie.
I don't want to be seen as a bragger like Trixie.
But you're the best!
Uh. Please, Spike, I said no!

Oh, how we gonna find an ursa major when I can't even see my own hoof in front of my face?
Oh, heh. That's better.
Yaaaah!
Yaaaah!

Hey, guys, where ya goin'?
Can't talk now.
Got a major problem!
Yeah, ursa major, to be exact.
Huh?
Trixie!
Twilight!

Trixie thought she said the Great and Powerful Trixie did not want to be disturbed!
Actually, it's a big one.
What is so important that you cannot wait until morning to disturb Trixie?

Twilight! You've gotta come! Quick!
I already told you, Spike, I don't wanna show up Trixie!
No, you don't understand, it's—
Uh, is that what I think it is?
Majorly.

Great and Powerful Trixie, you've got to vanquish the ursa.
Yeah, vanquish so we can watch.
It took a lot of trouble to get that thing here.
But, you're the Great and Powerful Trixie.
Yeah, remember? You defeated an ursa major.
Heh. Piece of cake.
Aw, come on, Trixie.
Stop goofin' around and vanquish it, eh?
Well, that was a dud.
Yeah, pfft, come on! Where's all the cool explosions and smoke and stuff like earlier? You know.
Uh-oh.
What's going on?
We brought an ursa to town.
You what!?!
Don't worry, the Great and Powerful Trixie will vanquish it.
I can't.
What!?
Oh, I can't, I never have. No one can vanquish an ursa major. I just made the whole story up to make me look better.
Made it up!?
Nice use of number sixteen.
Golly, dont'cha know?
That's new.
Unbelievable!
That was amazing!
Heavens to Betsy! We knew you had ability, but not that much!
I'm sorry. Please, please don't hate me.
Hate you?
Why, whatever do you mean, darling?
Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie's showing off with her magic tricks, and I just thought--
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Magic's got nothing to do with it. Trixie's just a loudmouth.
Most unpleasant.
All hat and no cattle.
So, you don't mind my magic tricks?
Your magic is a part of who you are, sugarcube, and we like who you are. We're proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as our friend.
And after whuppin' that ursa's hind quarters, we're even prouder.
You are?
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Wow, Twilight, how'd you know what to do with that ursa major?
That's what I was doing when you came looking for me. I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was compelled to do a little reading up on them.
So it is possible to vanquish an ursa major all by yourself?
That wasn't an ursa najor, it was a baby, an ursa minor.
That was just a baby?
And it wasn't rampaging, it was just cranky because someone woke it up.
Awww...
Well, if that was an ursa minor, then what's an ursa major like?
You don't wanna know.
Huh. You may have vanquished an ursa minor, but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie!
Why, that little...
Just let her go. Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson. Now, about you two.
We just wanted to see some awesome magic.
Yeah! And the way you vanquished that ursa minor was awesome!
We deserve whatever punishment you give us.
For starters, you can clean up this mess. And... What do you think, Spike? Should I give them number twenty five?
Oh, twenty five! Yes! And I think I deserve it, too.
Heah?
I think you're right.
Sweet!

Dear Princess Celestia,
I was so afraid of being thought of as a showoff that I was hiding a part of who I am. My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents, and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off... Especially when you're standing up for your friends.
So, you finally admit that you're the most talented unicorn in all of Ponyville?
Well, yeah, but it's nothing to brag about. So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?
Eh, she didn't go for the mustache.
You know, Spike, that mustache has nothing to do with who you really are. Maybe you should just try being yourself.
Or... Maybe the mustache wasn't enough. Maybe if I had a mustache and a beard?
Uh, not this again!
Okay, imagine me with a nice, long, Fu Manchu type beard. Or maybe a goatee. Oh, no a soulpatch right on my chin!


Oh, goodness. Are you okay?
Are you coughing because there's a carrot stuck in your throat?
Because you need some water?


Don't be such a scaredy-pony. It's just me, future Equestria ball-bouncing record holder. Three forty six, three forty seven...
This calls for a celebration!
Oh, no, Pinkie Pie, this is no time for celebration. This is a time for panic, for--
Ooo! I'm going to need balloons! One for every pony in Ponyville!
There's-- there's smoke. And-- and where there's smoke, there's fire. And--
Let's see, that's one, two, three, four...
Three hundred fifty four...
Five, six...
Three hundred fifty five, no, wait...
Seven.
Pinkie Pie! Now I have to start over.
We're all going to have to start over, in a new village. 'Cause ours is gonna be--
Hey, Rainbow Dash, wait up!
Oh, please, this is an emergency. I-I need every pony to--
Listen up! Smoke is spreading over all of Equestria.
What? Oh no! That's awful!
That's what I've been trying to--
But don't worry, I've just received a letter from Princess Celestia informing me that it is not coming from a fire.
Oh, thank goodness.
It's coming from a dragon.
A... d-dragon?

What in the name of all things cinnamon swirled is a full-grown dragon doing here in Equestria?
Sleeping.
Huh?
According to Princess Celestia, he's taking a nap. His snoring is what's causing all this smoke.
He should really see a doctor. That doesn't sound healthy at all.
Well, at least he's not snoring fire. What are we meant to do about it?
I'll tell you what we're meant to do. Give him the boot. Take that. And that!
We need to encourage him to take a nap somewhere else. Princess Celestia has given us this mission, and we must not fail. If we do, Equestria will be covered in smoke for the next one hundred years.
Hmph. Talk about getting your beauty sleep.
All right everypony, I need you to gather supplies quickly. We've got a long journey ahead of us. Let's meet back here in less than an hour.
Okay, girls, you heard her. The fate of Equestria is in our hooves. Do we have what it takes?
Um, actually...

Raaah!
Yaaa!
Ewww! Much better. Onward!
Let's go!

All right girls, listen up. I'm mapping out the fastest route, but we've all got to keep a good pace if we expect to make it up the mountain by nightfall.
M-m-mountain?
The dragon is in that cave at the very top.
Looks pretty cold up there.
You bet it is. The higher you go, the chillier it gets.
Good thing I brought my scarf.
Ooo! Pretty!
Heh, oh yeah. That'll keep you nice and cozy.
Uh-huh. Well, we could go this way.
But if I could just have a second...
Uh-huh. No, we want to avoid that.
So, um, I was thinking that, um, maybe I should just stay here in Ponyville.
Uh-huh.
Oh! Good. I'll stay here and--
Wait! You have to come! Your way with wild animals will surely come in handy.
I don't think I--
Oh, and don't worry about your little friends in the meadow. Spike's got it covered while you're gone.
You can count on me! Oooh! Hey! Hey! Wait!
Are you sure you want Fluttershy to come along? I mean, that pony's afraid of her own shadow. She's just going to slow us down.
Oh, she's just a little nervous. Once we get going, I'm sure she'll be fine.
All right girls, move out!

Whoa. What was that?
That is what it sounds like when a dragon snores.
It-- it's so... high!
Well, it is a mountain. I'm going to fly up there and check it out! Wah!
Hold on, now. I think we should all go up together. Safety in numbers an all.
Oh, all right.
I hear the only thing that sparkles more than a dragon's scales are the jewels they use to build their nests. Ooo, if I play my cards right, I might be able to convince him to part with a few!
Girls, this is no laughing matter! Fluttershy, you're the expert on wild creatures. What do you think the dragon will be like? Fluttershy?
Hey! What are you waiting for? An invitation?
Ooo, I think I have one in my bag!
I-it's so... so... steep.
Well, it is a cliff. You could just, oh, I don't know, fly up here?
Come on, Fluttershy, you can do it. Flap those wings!
Augh.
Uh, we don't have time for this. What are you doing?
I'll need this if I'm going to take her around the mountain another way.
Don't worry, Twi. We'll be there lickety-split.

Whoo-hoo! I win again!
Ugh. That's thirty-five games in a row. Best of seventy-one?
Told you it was going to take them forever.

Your turn, Fluttershy.
But... it's so... wide.
Come on, Fluttershy, we should be much farther along by now.
You could just leap on over.
I--
I don't know.
There's nothing to be afraid of. It's just a hop, skip and a jump. See?

It's not very far
Just move your little rump
You can make it if you try with a hop, skip and jump


We don't have time for this.

A hop, skip and jump,
Just move your little rump,
A hop, skip and jump,
A hop, skip and jump,
A hop, skip and jump,
A hop skip and jump,
A hop skip and jump!

O-okay. Here I go. A hop.
That's it.
You've got it.
Almost there.
Skip.
Just don't look down.
Ugh.
I guess I forgot to jump.

An... an ava... ava...
Shhh!
AVALA--!
Oh no! Help! Ooh!
Thanks to you I am.
Eugh. Bu-la-la-la-la.
Whoo-hoo! Let's do it again!
Uh! This is why a girl always packs extra accessories. Oh, please tell me I brought the tiara that goes with this.
Uh, think we got bigger problems than making sure our hair bows match our horseshoes.
Aw, no big whoop, sugar cube.

Wha! Wha...
My apologies.
Not your fault.
We're about to find out. We're here. Rainbow Dash, you'll use your wings to clear the smoke.
Mm-hmm.
Rarity and Pinkie Pie, you'll create a diversion to distract the dragon if things get a little hairy in there.
Applejack, you're ready with the apples in case he decides to attack. But it shouldn't come to that, because Fluttershy will do what she needs to do to wake him up, and between the two of us, we should be able to get him to understand why he needs to go. Is everypony ready?
I-- I-- I can't go in the cave.
Oh, great. She's scared of caves now, too.
What's that, sugarcube?
What?
I'm scared of dragons!
But Fluttershy. You have a wonderful talent dealing with all kinds of animals.
Yes, because they're not dragons.
Oh come on! We've seen you walk right up to a horrible manticore like it was nothing.
Yes, because he wasn't a dragon.
Spike is a dragon. You're not scared of him.
Yes, because he not a huge, gigantic, terrifying, enormous, teeth-gnashing, sharp-scale having, horn-wearing, smoke-snoring, could eat a pony in one bite, totally all grown-up dragon!
But, if you're so afraid of dragons, why didn't you say something before we came all the way up here?
I was afraid to.
Augh.
All of us are scared of that dragon.
I'm not!
Almost all of us are scared of that dragon, but we've got a job to do. So, get in there with Twilight and show her what you're made of.
I-- I-- I just... can't.
Oh, Fluttershy.

I'm goin' in. He... probably just doesn't realize what he's doing. Right?
Mr. Dragon.
Excuse me.
Mr. Dragon.
Oh, good, you're awake. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Twilight--

Now what?
Personally, I think you should skip the snoozing and be out there, showing them off. Hmm. Obviously, I would be more than happy to keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone.

I was this close to getting that diamond.
You mean... getting rid of that dragon?
Oh, yeah... sure.
What in tarnation...?
Darling, you look ridiculous.
Exactly! Sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way to get someone on your side! Hi!
Apparently he doesn't like laughing, heh. Or sharing.
All right, that's it. We tried persuasion, charm, whatever it is Pinkie Pie does.
It's time to stop wasting time! I'm going in!
Rainbow! No!
Heh. Sorry.
Who-o-o-o-o-a!
Ugh!
How dare you... How dare you! Listen here, mister. Just because you're big doesn't mean you get to be a bully. You may have huge teeth, and sharp scales, and snore smoke, and breathe fire. But you do not-- I repeat-- You do not! Hurt! My! Friends! You got that?
Well?
But that rainbow one kicked me.
And I am very sorry about that. But you're bigger than she is, and you should know better. You should also know better than to take a nap where your snoring can become a health hazard to other creatures.
But I--
Don't you 'but I' me, mister. Now what do you have to say for yourself? I said, what do you have to say for yourself?
There, there. No need to cry. You're not a bad dragon, you just made a bad decision. Now go pack your things. You just need to find a new place to sleep. That's all.
You did it! I knew you could do it.

Spike, take a letter.
Dear Princess Celestia,
I am happy to report that the dragon has departed our fair country, and that it was my good friend, Fluttershy, who convinced him to go. This adventure has taught me to never lose faith in your friends. They can be an amazing source of strength, and can help you overcome even your greatest fears.
Always your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle.
Twilight! You gotta come see this! She's just five away from a new pony record!
Three hundred forty-seven, three hundred forty-eight...
Dragon!
Pinkie Pie, you scared me! I mean, uh, you... broke my concentration.


Hmm. Hah! Perfect.
Somepony has to. You were making an absolute mess of the town square, Applejack.
Yeah, well, the storm's gonna make an even bigger mess if we don't prune all these loose branches so they don't tumble down on anypony.
I simply cannot imagine why the Pegasus ponies would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening and ruin what could have been a glorious sunny day.
Oh no! My wonderfully styled mane shall be ruined!
Ya shoulda hurried up and finished the job already.
Oh! Ah! Oh Ph!! It's coming down too fast! Ah! Oh! Oh! Ah! Help me!
Uh, there. Hunker down to yer heart's content whilst I finish things.
What now?
I prefer not to get my hooves muddy.
Guh. There is just no pleasin' ya, is there? Everything's got to be just so.
Y'all wouldn't know useful if it came up and bit'cha.
Does so.
Does not.
Does so.
Does not.
Does so.
Does not.
Does so infinity. Hah.
Does not infinity plus one. Heh. What say we go our separate ways before one of us says something she will regret?
I reckon y'all are gonna say something you'll regret first.
On the contrary, I believe it shall most certainly be you who says something you will regret first.
I'm not sayin' anythin'.
Nor am I.
Y'all just be on yer way, then.
After you!
Perhaps we should stick together for now and find some shelter.
Uh-huh, perhaps we should. And fast.


Heh. Nice and dry under here, sorta.
Oh! Unacceptable.
Applejack! Rarity! Applejack! Rarity!
Twilight?
Come inside girls, quick.
Whoa, nelly. Is inside a tree really the best place to be in a lightning storm?
It is if you have a magical lightning rod protecting your home like I do. Come on in!
Hah! We are most grateful for your invitation.
Thank ya kindly for yer hospitality.
Uh, do be a polite house guest and go wash up please, won't you?
Some storm, huh? The Pegasus ponies sure have outdone themselves this time. I hope you and Applejack don't have any trouble getting home.
It may indeed be a problem.
All You've Ever Wanted to Know About Slumber Parties But Were Afraid to Ask.
My own personal copy. It's a fantastic reference guide. You should see the table of contents. I've been waiting for a chance to use it, and today is the day! This is gonna be so great!

Silly! This is called a mud mask. It's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion.
We're giving each other makeovers! Eee-hee! We have to do it, it says so in the book.
Hurray slumber party!
Blahch. What in the world is this for?
Puffiness-schmuffiness! That's good eatin'!(Loud chewing)
Hee-hee! Isn't this exciting? We'll do everything by the book, and that will make my slumber party officially fun.
Did you hear that, Applejack? You certainly would not want to do anything that would ruin Twilight's very first slumber party, would you?
Of course not, 'n you wouldn't either, I reckon?
So do we have an agreement?
Oh! Gross! You know, there's messy and there's just plain rude.
You know, there's fussy, 'n there's just plain gettin' on my nerves.
Fortunately, I can get along with any pony, no matter how difficult she may be.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm the get-alongin'ist pony yer ever gonna meet.
That's not even a word.
This is going to be the bestest slumber party ever! Yay!
Yay.

So, how are you getting along over there, Applejack?
Just fine, Rarity.
Me! I'd like to tell y'all the terrifying tale of the prissy ghost who drove everypony crazy with her unnecessary neatness. Oo-oo! I'm sure y'all are familiar with that one?
Never heard of it, but I have a much better one. It's the horrifying story of the messy, inconsiderate ghost who irritated every pony within a hundred miles! Oo-oo!
That's not a real story. You made it up.
It is a ghost story, they're all made up.
I've got one! This story is called The Legend of The Headless Horse. It was a dark and stormy night, just like this one. And three ponies were having a slumber party, just like this one...

...and just when the last pony thought she was safe, there, standing right behind her, just inches away was -- The Headless Horse!
Ghost story, check. Now, who wants s'mores?

Ooo!
Aw, I was just about to, but you interrupted me. Pardon.
S'mores, check. Now the next item of fun we have to do is Truth or Dare.
I dare Applejack to do something carefully and neatly for a change.
Oh yeah? Well I dare Rarity ta lighten up and stop obsessin' over every last little detail, for a change.
I think the truth of the matter is that some pony could stand to pay a little more attention to details.
And I think the truth is some pony oughta quit with her fussin' so the rest of us can get things done.
Um, I don't think this is how the game's supposed to work. You have to give an honest answer to any question or do whatever any pony dares you to do.
I dares you to step outside and let your precious, tidy mane get ruined again.
You have to. It's the rule.
Hah!
Okay. I dare Applejack to play dress-up in a frou-frou, glittery, lacey outfit.
Um, do I ever get a turn?
I dare ya to enter the next rodeo when it comes to town.
I dare you not to enter the next rodeo that comes to town.
I dare ya to not comb your mane a hundred times before bed.
And I dare you to comb yours just once.
I, uh, I think we should check off Truth or Dare and move on. Let's see what our next fun-fun-fun thing is, shall we? Hm, what does this mean? Pillow fight?
Oh, I get it! Pillow, fight! Fun! Ugh. Ah. Uh, girls? Maybe we should take it down a notch?
I will if she will.

Keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed.
My hooves ain't muddy.
They were. There might still be a little on them.
There ain't. See?
Eww!
Now who's bein' inconsiderate?
I have to make the bed again so the blanket will be right. Get up.
Hey!
Ah ah ah! You'll ruin it. You have to do it like this. Mm, uh, ooh, u-u-u-uh, uh, ah.
Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Geronimo!
Hey!
Ah.
You did that on purpose.
Um, yeah?
Get up so I can fix it again.
M-mmm!
I ain't budgin'.
You will if you want any blankets.
Give it back!
I will not!
Yes, you will!
Won't!
Will!
Won't!
Will!
Won't!
Will!
Enough! It says right here that the number one thing you're supposed to do at a slumber party is have fun, and thanks to you two I can't check that off!
I've been tryin' my darndest to get along.
No, it is I who have been trying my best.
No, it was me.
No, it was I.
Me!
I!
I hope you're happy, both of you. You've ruined my very first slumber party. The makeover, the s'mores, Truth or Dare, the pillow fight... I mean, is there anything else that could possibly go wrong?
Sorry I asked.

Ya see? That's why we needed to take down all those loose branches in town, not spiffy 'em up.
But I--
Outta my way, missy! Time's a-wastin'.
Wait! Stop! Don't!
No waitin'! No stoppin'! Doin'! And that, my friends, is what we call gettin' 'er done.
It's... Well, it's not okay. There's a giant tree branch in the middle of my bedroom, and the book doesn't say anything about having a giant tree branch at your slumber party. Or at least I haven't found that entry yet. Ooh... ah!
What in tarnation are y'all doin' over there?
Cleaning up this mess some pony made. Who was that again? Oh, right, that's you.
We gotta do somethin'!
Baking... BFFs... Brothers... There's nothing in here about branches.
What was that?
I said I'm sorry! I should'a listened to you when you noticed where this here branch would end up. Yer annoyin' attention to detail would'a saved us from this whole mess. But right now, ya need to stop bein' so dang fussy pickin' up all the little things and help me move the one big thing in here that actually matters! Please!
Uh. Uh, but I'll get all icky.
Consarnit! What the... eh... you... I mean, yes, ickiness is often a side effect of hard work. But y'all need to get over it, on account I just can't fix this mess I made myself. I need your help.
Oh. Let's do this.
Well, they do have a section about backyard slumber parties. Is that what we're doing right now? Does this count as camping?
U-ugh. Oh, I look awful.
Better?
Hmph, thanks.
Oh, pretty! Where did these come from? They're not in the book either.

Is it bigger than a barn?
Is it smaller than a saddle?
Are we getting warmer?
Why? Is it too cold in here for you? I can turn up the heat.
She means are we gettin' any closer with our guesses?
Oh! No. And that technically counted as a question, so only two more left!
Is it... a six-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted mane and shootin' stars comin' out of his eyes?
Who flies through the air all over the world to hide magic, sparkly eggs?
That's it!
It is?
See? We could have been having fun like this all along.
If only somepony hadn't been so persnickety.
Well, maybe she wouldn't have been if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy.
Sorry for being such a pain in the patootie.
Oh, no, I'm sure I was much worse.
That's kind of ya to say, but I'm the one who's sorry.
Oh, I'm much more sorry than you are.
Ugh. Are not.
Are too.
Are not!
Are too.
Are not.
Are too.
I declare my first slumber party a success!
Have fun, check.

Now take two steps to your left. Uh, no, my left.

Dear Princess Celestia,
It's hard to believe that two ponies who seem to have so little in common could ever get along. But I found out that if you embrace each other's differences, you'd just might be surprised to discover a way to be friends after all.

So, who's up for another slumber party tomorrow night? Ugh. How about a week from Thursday? Oh, how about two weeks from Saturday? A month from now?


Wow, what a gorgeous day!
Rainbow Dash must have gotten up early for once and cleared all the clouds away.
I bet all of Ponyville is going to be out enjoying the sunshine. What? Where is everypony?
Is it some sort of pony holiday?
Not that I know of.
Not more than usual.
Is it... zombies?!
Uh... not very likely.
Not likely... but possible?
Psst! Twilight! Spike! Come here! Come! Here! Hurry! Before she gets you!
Who?! The zombie pony?
Z-Zombie pony?!
Spike! There are no zombie ponies. Pinkie, what are you doing here alone in the dark?
I'm not alone in the dark.
We're hidin' from her!


Did you see her Twilight? Did you see... Zecora?
Apple Bloom! I told you never to say that name.
Well, I saw her glance this way...
Glance evilly this way.
... And then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason.
No good reason? You call protectin' yer kin no good reason? Why, as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town, she started shakin' in her lil' horseshoes.
So I swept her up and brought her here.
I walked here myself!
For safe keepin'.
Applejack, I'm not a baby! I can take care of myself!
Not from that creepy Zecora.
She's mysterious.
Sinister.
And spoooooky!
Will you cut that out?
Just look at those stripes! So garish!
She's a zebra.
A what!?
A zebra, and her stripes aren't a fashion choice Rarity, they're what she was born with.
Born where? I've never seen a pony like that in these parts, 'cept... her!
Well, she's probably not from here, and she's not a pony. My books say that zebras come from a far away land. But I've never seen her in Ponyville. Where does she live?
That's just it, she lives in... the Everfree Forest!
Spike!
Uh, sorry.
The Everfree Forest just ain't natural. The plants grow...
Animals care for themselves...
And the clouds move...
All on their own!
And that wicked enchantress Zecora lives there doing her evil... stuff! She's so evil I even wrote a song about her!

She's an evil enchantress
She does evil dances
And if you look deep in her eyes
She'll put you in trances
Then what will she do?
She'll mix up an evil brew
Then she'll gobble you up
In a big tasty stew
Soooo... Watch out!

Wow. Catchy.
It's a work in progress.
This is all just a lot of gossip and rumors. Now tell me; what exactly have you actually seen Zecora do?
Well... Once a month, she comes into Ponyville.
Then, she lurks by the stores.
And then, she digs at the ground.
Yeah! Maybe she's just tryin' to be neighborly.
And maybe she's not lurking by the stores, maybe she's going to them, lurk free, to do some shopping?
Yeah! Everypony likes to shop. You know what I think?
Apple Bloom! Hush and let the big ponies talk.
W-what about digging at the ground? You've got to admit that's weird.
What if she's digging for innocent creatures?
I am sure there is an explanation for everything Zecora does. And if anypony here were actually brave enough to approach her, she would find out the truth.

You ponies are being ridiculous!
Well, I heard that Zecora eats hay.
Pinkie, I eat hay; you eat hay!
Yeah, but I heard it's the evil way she eats hay.
Hey! Where's Apple Bloom?
The door's open.
She went outside!
And Zecora's still out there.
Spike, you stay here in case Apple Bloom comes back.
Will do!

Apple Bloom?
You get back here right now!
Beware! Beware, you pony folk! Those leaves of blue are not a joke!
Y-you keep your creepy mumbo-jumbo to yourself, ya hear?
Beware! Beware!
Yeah, back at ya, Zecora! You and your lame curse are the ones who better beware!
And you! Why couldn't you just listen to yer big sister?
I...I...
Who knows what kind of nasty curse Zecora could have just put on you?
You guys, there's no such thing as curses!
Well, that's interesting to hear coming from Miss Magic Pants herself.
My magic, real magic, comes from within. It's a skill you're born with. Curses are artificial, fake magic. It's conjured with potions and incantations; all smoke and mirrors meant to scare. But curses have no real power, they're just an old pony tale.
Just you wait, Twilight. You're gonna learn that some pony tales really are true.

She's an evil enchantress, she does evil dances!
Beware! Beware!
If you look deep in her eyes, she will put you in trances!
Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!
Wicked, wicked zebra!
... it's a curse.
Then what will she do?
Just you wait, Twilight; some pony tales really are true.
Then she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew! Soooo... Watch out!


No no no no no! None of these books have a cure! Ugh! There has to be a real reason for this! An illness? An allergy?!
A curse!
I said a real reason. Something that points to something real.
How about this one?
"Supernaturals"? Spike, the word supernatural refers to things like ghosts and spirits and zombies, which are as make-believe as curses. This book is just a bunch of hooey!
But what if you're wrong, Twilight? What if this really is a-
Ah pfurse!
A purse? How could it be a purse?
Pinkie? What happened?
Pee pah Zthecora! Sthe put a cursthe on me!
Hey, say it, don't spray it, Pinkie!
It's a curse, I tells ya!
But Fluttershy... seems just fine!
Yes, there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with her.
Fluttershy? Are you okay? Is there something wrong with you? Would you care to tell us? So... you're not going to tell us? Yes you're not, or yes you will?
Good gravy, girl! What's wrong with you?!
It's not a curse!
I agree with Dash! We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex!
It's not a hex either!

This is all my fault. If I hadn't followed Zecora in the first place, none of this would have happened. I just gotta fix this.
Now where does she think she's goin' this time?
I don't care what you say, Twilight. It's time to pony up and confront Zecora. Come on, girls. Are you with me?
Ah am-pft!
And I as well.
Uh, I don't know. Seems awfully dangerous.
How about you, Applejack? Applejack?
Pf-she's gone-pft!
Aah! Or somepony stepped on her!
... or sat on her?
Rarity's hair!
Oh! OH! Pinkie, what are you doing? Ah, really. Aah! You ever hear of personal space?
Nopthe.
Apple Bloom is gone too!
I bet they went after Zecora.
Well we better go find them. Come on girls, let's go.
Hey, a little help here?
Oopsie! Sorry.
Uh... Spike? Are you coming?

Stop right there! Turn around right now, missy!
No.
No?! You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister!
Hehehe. Sorry, Applejack, but I'm the big sister now.
Apple Bloom, you come back here right this instant! I'm gonna tell Big McIntosh on you! Aw, pony feathers.

C'mon girls. We've got to get to Zecora's. Hurry!
Ooh... Ahaha. Easier said than done.
Rainbow! Thank Celestia! There's no time to lose! I need to get to Zecora's pronto! Giddyup pony!
Ex-CUSE me?
YEEE-HAW!
What the...
No, Rainbow Dash. Other way!

Oh. I look horrible!
Plis place plooks horrible!
Oh my. That place really does look horrible. Nice decorations, if you like creepy!
Sthe sthtole my sthong! Shthe shtole mm mm!
She stole your song?
Oh Pinkie. Doesn't sound anything like your song.

She's an evil enchantress
And she does evil dances
And if you look deep in her eyes
She will put you in trances
Then what would she do?
She'll mix up an evil brew
Then she'll gobble you up
In a big tasty stew
Soooo... Watch out.

You saw those terrible things. Now do you believe us Twilight?
Mmm! The perfect temperature for ponies, I presume. Now, where is that little Apple Bloom?
Or... what if she's making Apple Bloom soup?!

What if she's making Apple Bloom soup?
I'm comin' for ya, Apple Bloom!
Aaah!
Whoa there. Easy, Rainbow Crash.
What have you done with Apple Bloom?
Ahh!
We're onto you Zecora. I didn't want to believe that you cursed us, but the evidence is overwhelming!
You made me look ridiculous.
You made me sound ridiculous!
You ruined my horn!
How dare you! You destroy my home, destroy my work. Then rudely accuse me of being a jerk?
You put this curse on us, now you're gonna uncurse us.
It is unwise to venture down this road. Your actions will make my anger explode!
Where is Apple Bloom!?
Zecora! I think I found all the things ya asked for. What in Ponyville is goin' on here?
Why wouldn't I be?
Because Zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us and was gonna cook you up into soup!
Oh Twilight. Did those silly fillies finally get in yer head? You know there's no such thing as a curse.
Apple Bloom, sweetie. You can't just stand there and tell me this isn't a curse.
This isn't a curse.
It was a warnin'. About that blue plant. It's called Poison Joke.
That plant is much like poison oak. But its results are like a joke.
What in the hay does that mean?
It means this plant does not breed wrath. Instead this plant just wants a laugh.
... Will somepony please talk normal?
I think what she's saying is that when we ran in to save Apple Bloom, we ran into the poison joke. All our problems are just little jokes that played on us.
LITTLE JOKES?! Very funny.
Ok, fine. But what about the cauldron?
And the chanting?
And the creepy decor?
Treasures of the native land where I am from. This one speaks 'hello', and this 'welcome'.
Not welcoming at all, if you ask me.
The words I chanted were from olden times. Something you call a nursery rhyme.
But the cauldron... The Apple Bloom soup?
Looky here Twilight. That pot of water wasn't for me, it was for all these herbal ingredients. The cure for poison joke is a simple old-natural remedy. You just gotta take a bubble bath!
But I tried to find a cure in all my books and couldn't find anything. What book has this natural remedy?
Here is the book, you see? Sad that you lack it in your library.
Natural Remedies and Cure-alls That Are Simply Super. I...I... I'm so sorry, Zecora. I had the answer the whole time, if only I had bothered to look inside.
Hahaha.
Zecora? Would you be kind enough to mix up another batch of the herbal bath?
Mix it up I certainly will. Yet I am missing an herb from Ponyville.
But whenever Zecora comes to town, all the shops are mysteriously closed.
Oh, well... I think we can help you with that.

Look Rose! How awful!
The wicked enchantress has cursed them all.
The horror, the horror!
Run, ponies! Run!
Daisy, we need to talk.

Dear Princess Celestia,
Never judge a book by its cover. Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary. But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside. Real friends don't care what your "cover" is; it's the "contents" of a pony that count. And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever.

Your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle

Miss Zecora, I would love to get the recipe for this bath. It's simply luxurious!
Applejack! Hey, where's Applejack?!
I'm right here, little sis. I ain't tiny no more!
Oh! I have never felt so lovely in all my life!
Oh, my gosh! I never realized how horrible it is not to be able to talk. I mean, I love talking so much, and when I couldn't talk anymore, my tongue was all 'ehhhh'! It was the worst! Don't you agree, Fluttershy?


these flowers are for Princess Celestia. Only the prettiest ones will do. La, la la, la la, la la, la la.
Gah!
Hello, little guy. I've never seen anything like you before.
You're the cutest thing ever! I can't wait to show you to my friends.


Oh! Hurry up, Spike! This place isn't gonna clean itself.
It also didn't mess itself up.
Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!
I thought this was just an unofficial casual visit.
There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty. I want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a dent in the clutter.
Maybe you should, ugh, start reading them one at a time--wooah hoaw! Aw.
Everything's got to be perfect. No time for fooling around.
You know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet.
Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming.

What happened to the rest of her name?
We couldn't fit it all in.
You can't hang a banner that says "Welcome Princess Celest". Take it down and try again.

That looks perfect. Keep up the good work.

Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. How's the banquet coming?
Uh...it would be coming a little better if...
Pinkie! What are you doing? Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess.
I know. That's why I'm tasting them. Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue, and I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a king, or a queen, or a princess.
Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe... oh, I'm sorry. Uh, am I interrupting?
You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest. Come on out, little guy. It's okay.
They're amazing. What are they?
I'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from.
I'll take one off your hooves. I've never seen anything so... adorable. Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying.
Pinkie, do you want the other one?
UGH! A parasprite? Are you kidding?
Ugh?
A para-what?
How could you not like...
Ugh. Now I gotta go find a trombone.
A what?
Ahhh, typical Pinkie.

Stand still, Rainbow Dash.
Ugh, I caaan't, I need to flyyy! This is waaay too boring for me.
Do you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?
Wow. Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous.
Mmhmm. Thank you, Twilight. Nice to know someone appreciates my talents.
Ugh, sooo boooring.
Huh?
What's that sound, Twilight?
Wow, what are they?
The better question is, where did they come from? I only had one a minute ago.
Uh, I'll take one.
Me too, oh, they're perfect.
Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?
Girls! Hello! This is important. Durgh! Thanks a lot.


Spike! Wake up! What happened?
Huh? Whaaa! What's going on?
Where did they come from?
I don't know. The little guy got hungry in the night, so I gave him a snack, but... I have no idea where these others came from. Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work!
The princess will be here in a few hours.
Ugh.
Spike, help me round up these little guys.
Ugh, what does it look like I'm doin'? Ooow, waaah! D'oh. I know, I know, "stop fooling around".


Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful.

Ugh, Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now.
And I'm not? You know how many more instruments I've gotta find? A lot, that's how many. Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time.
Please, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt. I've got a real problem.
You've got a real problem alright. And a banjo is the only answer!

Ditto!
Fluttershy knows everything about animals, I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying.
...or not.

Ugh, do something Fluttershy, can't you control them?
I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely and...
Guh.


If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster.
Ew! If you ask me it's already a total disaster.
Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many. HEY!
What do we do?
Yeah! We can drive 'em back into the forest.
Aye aye.
Yeeeeeee-haw!
Alright y'all, here goes nothin'. Look out Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away. Keep a lead on 'em, Rainbow Dash. Hold on girls, we're almost there.
Pinkie!
Twilight, we don't have much time.
You're telling me. The princess could arrive at any moment.
Exactly. That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some maracas.
Maracas? Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas.
Pinkie Pie, you are so random.
And you are all so stubborn!
Forget her ladies. Focus. Head 'em up and move 'em out.

Ouch.
We did it. Nice work, Applejack.
Couldn't a'done it without y'all.
Now let's get back and clean up the mess they made before the princess arrives.

Okay, everyone knows what to do, right? We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time.
Where did they come from?
Well, I may have kept just one. Heh. I couldn't help myself. They're just so cute.
We don't have time to keep rounding up these things. What do we do now?
Time to take out the adorable trash. YAAAAAA!
Looks like our problems are solved.
Whoa. Yaa! Yow! Woah! Wow! I can't hold it! She's breaking up.
Pinkie Pie, what have you done?
I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done.
Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second? You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville.
Me? Ruin? I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruin-ee! Or is it ruiness? Ruinette?
Come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one. She's a few apples short of a bushel.
Hey! I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof. If you just slow down and listen to me!

Aah!
What do we do? They're eating all the food in town.
Heh. Hey, it worked. They're not eating the food anymore.
Oh no... if they get inside my store... Everypony for herself!

I'll save you!

No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family's crop.

Help!
Help...

Ugh. Have you gone mad?
Zecora, these little guys are devouring Ponyville, and the princess is on her way. Can you help us, please?
Oh, monster of so little size. Is that a parasprite before my eyes?
I don't know! Is it?
Tales of crops and harvests consumed. If these creatures are in Ponyville, you're doomed.

Aaaah, aaaaaaah!
Okay, here's the plan. Rainbow Dash, you distract them.
YAAAA!
Good. Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there. We've got less than a minute. Zecora was right, we're doomed. Oh no, the princess's procession is here. It's all over!
Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here. This is no time for your... nonsense?

Look.
Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil.
Hello, princess.
So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends.
So... how was the trip? Hit much traffic?
Ah, what is this? Oh ho ho, these creatures are adorable.
They're not that adorable.
I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville have organized a parade in honor of my visit.
Parade? Oh. Yes, the parade.
Unfortunately, that visit is going to have to wait for another time. I'm afraid an emergency has come up in Fillydelphia. Apparently there's been some sort of infestation.
An... infestation?
Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures has invaded the poor town. I'm sorry Twilight, to have to put you all through so much trouble.
Trouble? What trouble?
Before I have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person?
My... report?
Haven't you learned anything about friendship?
Actually, I have. I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it. It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives...
Even when they don't always seem to make sense.
I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle, and I'm very impressed with your friends as well. It sounds like you're all learning so much from each other.
Thank you, princess.
Hey, what happened to the princess?
Emergency in Fillydelphia.
Some sort of infestation.
Oh no! Have they got parasprites too? Well, have tuba, will travel.
I think the princess can handle it.
So you knew what those critters were all along, huh Pinkie Pie?
Well, DUH! Why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments? I tried to tell you.
We know, Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen.
You're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you.
Thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when I don't understand me.
You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia, and more importantly, you saved Ponyville.

...Or not.


Huh? Mommy?
Winter Wrap Up!
You're not mommy.
Spike, the first day of spring is tomorrow, so every pony in Ponyville needs to clean up winter. Now help me get ready.
Clean up winter? Who cleans up winter? Don't they just use magic to change the seasons like they do in Canterlot?
It's ridiculous. No magic... Fuh.
scarf, check; saddle, check; boots, check; Spike refusing to get up and going back to sleep, check. It's a good thing I'm so organized, I'm ready. Bright and early. Oh... maybe a little too early.


Those must be the team vests Rarity designed. Blue for the weather team, green for the plant team, and tan for the animal team. I wonder which team vest I'll be wearing.
I'll take a blue vest, same color as my blanket, which I think I hear calling my name. "Spike! Spike! Come to bed!" Ugh, it's too early.
Thank you, everypony, for being here bright and early. We need every single pony's help to wrap up winter, and bring in spring.
Now, all of you have your vests, and have been assigned to your teams, so let's do even better than last year, and have the quickest Winter Wrap Up ever!
Oh, this is so exciting.
Alright everypony, find your team leader, and let's get galloping!
Oh gosh, where should I go? I'm not sure where I fit in. What exactly does everypony do?

Three months of winter coolness
And awesome holidays


We've kept our hoovsies warm at home
Time off from work to play


But the food we've stored is runnin' out
And we can't grow in this cold


And even though I love my boots
This fashion's getting old


The time has come to welcome spring
And all things warm and green
But it's also time to say goodbye
It's winter we must clean
How can I help? I'm new, you see
What does everypony do?
How do I fit in without magic?
I haven't got a clue!


Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up!
Let's finish our holiday cheer
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up!


'Cause tomorrow spring–


–is here!


'Cause tomorrow spring is here!


Bringing home the southern birds
A Pegasus' job begins
And clearing all the gloomy skies
To let the sunshine in
We move the clouds
And we melt the white snow


When the sun comes up
Its warmth and beauty will glow!


Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up!
Let's finish our holiday cheer
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up!
'Cause tomorrow spring is here
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up!
'Cause tomorrow spring is here
'Cause tomorrow spring is here!


Little critters hibernate
Under the snow and ice


We wake up all their sleepy heads
So quietly and nice


We help them gather up their food
Fix their homes below


We welcome back the southern birds


So their families can grow!


Let's finish our holiday cheer
'Cause tomorrow spring is here
'Cause tomorrow spring is here
'Cause tomorrow spring is here!


No easy task to clear the ground
Plant our tiny seeds
With proper care and sunshine
Everyone it feeds
Apples, carrots, celery stalks
Colorful flowers too
We must work so very hard


It's just so much to do!


Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up!
Let's finish our holiday cheer
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up!
'Cause tomorrow spring is here
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up!


'Cause tomorrow spring is here


'Cause tomorrow spring is here!


Now that I know what they all do
I have to find my place
And help with all of my heart
Tough task ahead I face
How will I do without my magic
Help the Earth pony way
I wanna belong so I must
Do my best today,
Do my best today!


Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up!
Let's finish our holiday cheer
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up!
'Cause tomorrow spring is here
Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up!


'Cause tomorrow spring is here
'Cause tomorrow spring is here
'Cause tomorrow spring is here!

Everypony belongs to a team. What should I do? Where should I go?
Alright team, you're clear for takeoff.
Rainbow Dash!
Oh, hey Twilight, what's up?
What are you doing?
Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve the birds that have flown south for the winter.
Oh, can I help? How about if I help clear out the clouds?
Um...
Right. No wings.
Sorry, Twilight.
Come on Spike, this is serious business. Winter needs to be wrapped up, and I'm determined to do my part. Somehow.

Rarity, please tell me there's something, anything I can help you with.
Well, how would you like to help create Ponyville's finest birds' nests?
Birds' nests?
Why yes. When the weather team guides the birds back north for the spring, they'll need a place to live and lay their eggs.
Wow, Rarity, that one's really beautiful.
Oh why, thank you most sincerely. Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?
Would I? Yes! Where do I begin?
Okay. Now... uh, take some of that straw and hay over there, and a little bit of branch. Now, weave them through there, yes. Uh, take some ribbon, yes, oh uh, n... not there, oooh, yes, uh, tuck it in over there, uh but be careful not to... I don't know I guess that would do... oh dear.
There! It looks just like... yours. Oh my.
That nest needs to be condemned.
Oh, Spa-ha-hike, it's not so bad, ah, maybe birds can use it as a...
An outhouse?
Hw...
I think we lost her.
Ah, and we need to weave the string...

Hellooooooo, Twilight! Wheeeeeeee!
Wow, Pinkie Pie, you're quite the skater. Probably the best skater I've ever seen.
Thanks Twilight, I've been doing this since I was an itty-bitty little-wittle Twinkie-Pinkie. Just comes natural. Which is probably why they designated me the lake scorer. I cut lines in the lakes with my skates. That way, when the rest of the weather team comes here to break the ice, it'll be easy as pie.
How clever. When the thick ice begins to melt, it'll break along the lines. Well, you sure have a lot of work ahead of you, there's quite a few lakes in Ponyville.
Ha, tell me about it. Hey, Twilight, wanna help me out?
Would I?
Come on, put on those skates over there. I bet you'll be a natural too.
Okay.

Uh... maybe on second thought.
What are you talking about? You said you wanted to be helpful.
Yippie!
Now get out there.
Oh no, whoa, wow...
Twilight, steer! Steer!
Yaaaaa!
Oh boy...
Pwuh.
Twilight, you did a great job your first time around. I'm sure my first time was just as wobbly and bobbly and crasheriffic as yours.
Really?
No.
But did I make you feel better?
Mm-hmm, yeah, I guess.
I think you'll be super awesome at something that keeps your hoofs on the ground. I know, Fluttershy could probably use your help with the critters.
Well... I'm pretty good with little animals. Yeah, I'll go help her.
Uh... it's, ah, that a-way.
Yaaaaaa!

Wake up, little sleepy heads. Hope you had some wonderful dreams and restful hibernation, but it's time to get up now, spring is coming.
Awww, how cute.
Aren't they? This is my favorite task the whole season, when I get to see all my little animal friends again.
Uh, what's "hibernation"?
It's like a long sleep.
Long sleep?
I definitely like the idea of hibernation, uh, except for the "eat less food" part.
Oh, would you just look at all these warrens and dens? I'm worried that I won't be able to wake up every animal before spring comes.
Well, I'll help, Fluttershy.
You will? Oh, that would be wonderful.
Okay, let's start there.

Good morning, friends.

Right, because there's no magic. Why don't you just use magic, Twilight, and get it done the right way?
No, Spike, I have to do it the traditional way. Ponyville has never needed magic to wrap up winter.
Well, they never had you here before, either. Think how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.

Keep pushin', Caramel. That's it, Bumpkin. I know it's hard work, but you guys are doin' great. Yee-haw!
Hey, Applejack. How's everything going?
Oh, just dandy. Little slow startin', but peachy all the same. There's a lot of ground to clear ya hear. We can't even start the plantin' and the waterin' until we git all these heap a' snow high-tailed outta here.
Well, I'd like to help.
Well, I... I dunno Twilight.
Just give me a chance.
Well, I never turn down a hard worker, but...
Think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.
I could use a come-to-life spell. Hwww... Here goes...
Hmm. She's awful strong for such a little pony.
That's my girl, following my advice.
And what in tarnation does that mean?
Whoa-oa-oa!
What's going on? Wha'd'ya do? You used magic, didn't you?

Nuts, Twilight, you used magic.
The nerve. Can you believe her?
That's not how we do it 'round here, Twilight, and especially not on MAH farm.

Come on, Twilight. Come on out.
I'm a winter mess up.
Well you're good at a lot of things, just not nest-making, ice-skating, animal-waking, snow-clearing.
That's what I'm here for, sister.
Rainbow Dash, y'all on the weather team need to melt the rest of the snow here on the ground and the trees, pronto.
Got it.
Wait. My poor little animals' homes will get flooded if the snow melts too fast.
Got it.
I'm tellin' you, Rainbow, you gotta melt that snow now.
No, you simply must wait.
Okay.
Go.
Stop.
Go.
Stop.
GO!
STOP!
Ugh! Make up your minds!
Oh! What in Equestria are all you arguing about? This sort of silliness is why we were late for spring last year, and the year before that, and the year before that.
Did she say late?
I was hoping my amazingly inspirational speech would urge everyone to do better than last year, but now it looks like we're going to be later than ever. I mean just look at this catastrophe. The ice scorers made the ice chunks too big to melt; the nest designer is horrendously behind, we need several hundred, and she's only made one;
And don't get me started on all the clouds in the sky, the icicles on the trees... This isn't good, not at all!
And it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous if we can't get our seeds all planted.
Chillax Applejack, we're bustin' our chops as fast as we can.
No, not fast, we have to wake animals slowly.
Uh, AJ?
Oh good gravy, Caramel lost the grass seeds again, didn't he?
Eeyup.
Oh that featherbrain. Didn't she learn her lesson last year when she went west?
Stop this at once. We don't have time to argue. It's almost sundown. Spring is going to be late again. Another year of scandal and shame. If only we could be more organized.
Spike! Get my checklist and clipboard, STAT!
Eh, yes, ma'am.
Stop, everypony!
Stop!
Sorry. I know you all want to complete your jobs on time, but arguing is no way to go about it. What you need is organization, and I'm just the pony for the job.


I can't believe it. Spring is here! On time! And we have you to thank for it. If it weren't for your organizing skills we would still be arguing.
Eeyup.
It was a team effort.
And since you helped every team, we have an official vest for you. We give you the title, "All-Team Organizer".
Gosh, I don't even know what to say. Thank you, everypony.
And hereby I declare that winter is... wrapped up on time.
Spike's sure gonna be in for a hog-sized surprised when that last piece a' ice melts.

Dear Princess Celestia,
Winter Wrap Up was one of the most special things I've ever been a part of here in Ponyville. It helped me to learn we all have hidden talents, and if we're patient and diligent, we're sure to find them, and as always, with good friendship and teamwork, ponies can accomplish anything. How's that, Spike? Spike?


You can all see my cutie mark, can't you? Like all ponies, I wasn't born with a cutie mark. My flank was blank.
Aww...! She's so precious!
Then one day, when I was about your age, I woke up to find that a cutie mark had appeared.
Yes I know, but honestly, that's how everypony was wearing their mane back then. I had decided to become a teacher, and the flowers symbolized my hope that I could help my future students bloom if I nurture them with knowledge. The smiles represented the cheer I hope to bring to my little ponies while they were learning. Now, can anyone tell me when a pony gets his or her cutie mark?
Oh! Oh! Oh! When she discovers that certain something that makes her special!
PSSST!
What?!
Apple Bloom! Are you passing a note?
Uh, I... Um...


Want some sweets? I've got some peppermint sticks. I made them myself.
Mm-mm.
They'll make you smi-i-le.
No...
It's going to be amazing.
It's a party celebrating me and my fantastic cutie mark. How could it not be?
Gimme a break.
See you this weekend...

It's not fair! It's just not fair!
Don't get your mane in a tangle. You'll get your cutie mark. Every pony gets one eventually.
But I don't want one eventually! I want one right now! I can't go to Diamond Tiara's cute-ceañera without one, I just can't!

Get your delicious nutritious apples here!
Create fine art for your home with 'em. You have to be crazy not to get a bushel of your very own.
Heh... she's so creative, heh.
You, sir, care t' buy some apples?
No thanks.
Why not?
I have plenty at home.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm pretty sure I...
You're pretty sure, but you're not absolutely positively completely super-duper sure, are you?
Y...ah... If I buy some apples, will you please leave me alone?
Aaal-right!
You forgot your change!
Woo-hoo! That's how you sell s'm apples and get a cutie mark! So, what does my cutie mark look like? A shoppin' bag full of apples? A satisfied customer eating an apple? Hmm... maybe I gotta increase my sales figures first. YOU TOUCH IT, YOU BUY IT. We take cash or credit.
I'm sorry, ma'am. Ma'am! Aww... Now Apple Bloom, you can't just...
That'll be four bits.
I didn't put those in my bag.
Likely story. Four bits, lady!
Apple Bloom! I am really really sorry about that. She's new. Here, take these. No charge. ...and these. ...and these.
Y'all come back now, y'hear?
What?
Sorry little sis, but your apple-sellin' days are over.
What? But how else am I gonna get my cutie mark?
Home. Now.
Hm.
Ugh. Listen, sugarcube, I know it's hard to wait for your very own cutie mark, but, you just can't force it. Besides, you're not that grown-up just yet. Ain't there other fillies in your class without one?
Well... Twist doesn't have hers yet.
Do you think you'd feel better if you went to the party with her?
Mmm-hmm.
Well there you go. Bet you and Twist would have a great time together. Now run along and find your friend.
You're sure you don't want me to stick around 'till the end of th' market?
Hey! Who's been using my racket?
Yeah. I'm sure.

Oh, what's up, Apple Bloom?
So I was thinkin'... maybe we could go to Diamond Tiara's cute-ceañera together. I don't have a cutie mark, you don't have a cutie mark.
Well, um...
Isn't my cutie mark swell? I've always loved making my own favorite sweets, but it took me some time to discover that it was my super-special talent. Pretty sweet, huh?
Yeah, pretty... sweet.
Hey... this doesn't mean we can't go to the cute-ceañera together. You're still gonna come to the party, are you?
Of course she will.

Wow, looks like somepony's got a dark cloud hanging over her head. Let me do something about that. What's the matter, kid?
Applejack says these things take time. I have to just wait for it to happen.
Why wait for something to happen when you can make it happen?
But Applejack says th...
Hey, who are you gonna listen to, Applejack, or the pony who was first in her class to get a cutie mark? I always liked flying an' all, but I was going nowhere in a hurry. It wasn't until my very first race that I discovered a serious need for speed, and KAZAM, this sweet baby appeared as fast as lightning.

That's right, stretch out those legs. Gotta be nice and loose. The key here is to try as many things as possible as quickly as possible. One of them is bound to lead to your cutie mark. Are you ready?
I'm ready!
Are! You! Ready!
I'M READY!
Ah!
Whoa!
Hi-ya! Ee...
Whoaaa! Whoa...

Tried that one... tried that one... tried that one...
Your new outfit is, like, perfect for the party.
I know. It totally shows off my cutie mark.
I love being special.
Can you imagine how embarrassing it must be to be... not special?
I don't even want to, like, think about it.
Tried that one... tried that one...
I'm doomed. Doomed! I'll never find sumth'n I'm good at.
You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes.
Eatin' cupcakes?
Eating cupcakes?
Eating cupcaaakes!
I really appreciate all your help Rainbow Dash. You're a really great coach and I really learned a lot from you and I'm sure I can learn a lot more but... I've got some cupcakes to eat! See you at cute-ceañera! Hold on, Pinkie Pie, I'm comin'.

I can't believe I didn't think of this. A cupcake-eating cutie mark, it's sooo obvious. Now, where are those cupcakes? I'm ready t' chow down!
I don't have any cupcakes.
Oh.
I guess, uh, making-cupcakes cutie mark could work too.

All you have to do is take a cup of flour!
Add it to the mix!
Now just take a little something sweet, not sour!
A bit of salt, just a pinch!


Baking these treats is such a cinch!
Add a teaspoon of vanilla!
Add a little more, and you count to four,
And you never get your fill of...


Cupcakes! So sweet and tasty!
Cupcakes! Don't be too hasty!
Cupcakes! Cupcakes, cupcakes, CUPCAKES!

What about that?
Whoa, what's been going on in here?
We've been making cupcakes, wanna try them?
Nnnno thank you... not that they don't look, heh, delicious.
Twilight, you have to help me!
What's the matter?
Uhhh... I don't follow. How can I help you?
You can use your magic to make my cutie mark appear.
Oh no, Apple Bloom. A cutie mark is something a pony has to discover for herself.
Please Twilight, jus' trah.
I'm sorry but-
Oh please, please, please please please!
Alright alright!
I'm sorry, sweetie, but I told you-
Try again, try again!
Told you that not even magic can make a cutie mark appear before its time.
It's hopeless, hopeless! I just won't go to the party, I can't go. Everyone will just laugh at me and make fun of me and call me name. It will be the worst night of my life.
I'm sure it won't be as bad as all that.

How could I have forgotten the time? How could I have forgotten Pinkie Pie was hosting the party? How could I have forgotten it was at Sugarcube Corner?
Don't forget your party hat, Forgetty Forgetterson!
I have to get out of here before anypony sees me.
Hey! It's my cute-ceañera, I'm supposed to get the first bite at cake.
Okay, Apple Bloom, almost there.
Apple Bloom, you made it. After I heard about Twist, I was afraid you wouldn't show up. I sure am glad you came to your senses about this whole cutie mark thing. These things happen when these things are supposed to happen. Trying to rush 'em just drives you crazy. I'll let you be, looks like your friends want to talk to you.
Well well well, look who's here.
Nice outfit.
Just sumt'n I, uh, pulled together last minute.
It really shows off your cutie mark. Oh wait, that's right, you don't have one.
Uh, I have a cutie mark.
Eh, what? Since when?
Since... Um... Earlier today.
Oh really? Let's see it.
I shouldn't. I couldn't. My cutie mark is so unbelievably amazing, I'm afraid that if I show it off, everyone will start paying attention to me instead of you. Outshined at your own cute-ceañera - can you imagine how embarrassing that would be?
Uh, forget it, I didn't really want to see it anyway.
Oh no.
Wow, that is an amazing cutie mark.
Nice try...
Blank flank!
I said, you got a problem with blank flanks?
The problem is, I mean, she's like, totally not special.
No, it means she's full of potential.
She could be a great scientist, or an amazing artist, or a famous writer. She could even be mayor of Ponyville some day.
And she's not stuck being stuck-up like you two.
Hey, this is my party, why are you two on her side?
Because...
We thought we were the only two.
I for one think you are three very lucky fillies.
Lucky? How can they be lucky?
They still get to experience the thrill of discovering who they are, and what they're meant to be.
And they got all the time in the world to figure it out, not just an afternoon.
Wow, Apple Bloom, I wish I could be a scientist.
Do you really think you could be mayor?
Maybe I got my cutie mark too soon.
Hey, what's everypony doing? This is my party, everypony is supposed to be paying attention to me.
Whatever. We still think you're losers, right Diamond Tiara? Bump, bump, sugar... lump...
Not now, Silver Spoon.
Name's Scootaloo.
And I'm Sweetie Belle.
Apple Bloom.

This song is so super!
So I was thinking, now that we're friends... I mean, we are friends, right?
How could we not be? We're totally alike. We don't have cutie marks, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon drive us crazy--
Totally crazy.
Well, now that we're friends, what if the three of us work together to find out who we are and what we're supposed to be?
Ooh! Ooh! We could form our own secret society.
I'm liking this idea.
A secret society. Yeah. We need a name for it though.
The Cutie Mark Three?
The Cutastically Fantastics?
How about... The Cutie Mark Crusaders?
It's perfect!
This is gonna be so great!
We're gonna be unstoppable!
What do you say we celebrate with some of these delicious cupcakes?
NOT the cupcakes. Trust me.
Let's see if there are any cookies.
Yeah! Come on.

Dearest Princess Celestia,
I am happy to report that one of your youngest subjects has learned a valuable lesson about friendship. Sometimes, the thing you think will cause you to lose friends and feel left out...
...can actually be the thing that helps you make your closest friends and realize how special you are. Hmm...


Hoo-wee! Not a bad pitch for a pony who works with her head in the clouds.
Oh yeah? Think you can do better, cowgirl?
Heh! Looks like this Pegasus can pitch better than the workhorse. The object of the game is to get the closest to the stake.
All right, all right. You got another throw there, pony girl.
Yeah, yeah. I still have the closest throw, Applesmack. Just try and beat it.
I lost.
Ah, don't feel bad, Rainbow. It's all in good fun.
I hate losing.
Besides, you're a mighty good athlete. I'm just better. Heh heh heh.
All right, Applejack, you think you're the top athlete in all of Ponyville?
Well, I was gonna say in all of Equestria, but that might be gildin' the lily.
...and I think I'm the top athlete. So let's prove it.
Prove what?
I challenge you to an Iron Pony competition. A series of athletic contests to decide who's the best, once and for all.
You know what, Rainbow? You're on.


So you two are doing what, now?
An Iron--
Iron Pony competition.
See, we've set up a bunch of events to decide which one of us is--
And I'm here to...?
To be our judge and keep score.

Hello everypony, and welcome to the first annual Iron Pony competition!
Uh, Spike, who are you talking to?
Um... Uh, them! Let the games begin!

Ready. Set. Go!
Time, Spike?
17 seconds.
You're kiddin'! That breaks my record from last year's rodeo.
But you got a five second penalty for nudging the barrel.
Ready. Set. Go!
Woo! That was some fancy hoofwork there, Rainbow!
What was the time on that, Spike?
18 seconds!
18 seconds. Rainbow, are you sure you're not secretly a rodeo pony?
Rainbow Dash wins the barrel lead!
Oh, I can't believe I won.
Yeah, well, don't you go gettin' used to it.

Years of applebuckin'.
Ugh.

Waa-hoo!
Woohoo!
Eeyup!
Why me?
Go!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-hoa! Whoa! Whoaaa! Ouch.
Ready for another pony ride?
No.
Go!
Guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guhwhoaaaaaa
Rainbow Dash wins the bronco-buck.
And I lose.






Yeah.

Fillies and gentlecolts, at the halfway point, our competitors are tied at five and five.
Who are you talking to?
Them!

95, 96, 97, 98, 99... a hundred!
Yes!
Be a good sport, Applejack.



All right, you two. This is the final event. Give it all you've got.
Looks like the workhorse might come out ahead in this one.
Huh?
I can't understand you with that rope in your mouth.
Only 'cause you cheated.
What?
You used your wingpower to help you win over half those contests.
Sounds like sour apples to me.
Are you sayin' you didn't use your wings?
Well... no. But you never said I couldn't use my wings.
I didn't think I needed to tell you to play fair.
I still would have won even without my wings.
Hah! Prove it.
Gladly. How?
Tomorrow is the annual Runnin' of the Leaves. I challenge you to race me in it.
Heh! Easy shmeasy.
the point is to run, so no wings allowed.
No wings? No problem.

Twilight, hurry up, we're gonna be late for the race.
Why are you so excited about the race? It's only for ponies.
Fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the annual Running of the--
Welcome to the annual Running of the Leaves! This is Pinkie Pie, your official p-eye-in-the-sky announcer.
Sorry, Spike. I guess that job's already taken.
As everypony knows, the Running is a very important tradition, for without it, the autumn leaves of Equestria would never fall. So get ready, ponies. The Running of the Leaves will begin in five minutes.
Pardon me, excuse me. Make way for the Iron Pony.
The Iron Phony, you mean.
So, Applejack, you ready to win second place?
I'm ready to run a good, clean race.
Yeah, yeah...
You are not allowed to use your wings.
I could win this race with both wings tied behind my back.

Very funny.
'Least now we know we're racin' fair and square.
Racers! Please take your positions!
Um... Pinkie Pie?
Uh, yeah. I know you're doing the announcing today and stuff and... I'm sure you're gonna do a great job and all, but... I was just wondering...
What?
Aw... Forget it.
Spike! Would you like to be my co-reporter? We could comment on the action together.
We could?
Climb on up.
Twilight? What in tarnation are you doin' up here?
I'm racing.
I'm not joking.
What? You're not an athlete, you're a... well... you're an egghead.
I am not an egghead, I am well-read.
Well, no, but I do know a lot about running.
And you know this from...
Books. I've read several on the subject.
Scoff if you must, Rainbow. But the Running of the Leaves is a Ponyville tradition, and since I'm here to learn, I've decided I should experience it myself.
Yeah. See you at the finish line... Tomorrow.
All right, ponies, are you ready?
Get set.
And they're off!
Welcome to the official coverage of the Running of the Leaves! You know, Spike, despite its name, the leaves don't do any of the actual running. No, that's left to My Little Ponies.
Why, yes, Pinkie, it's the running of the ponies that causes the leaves to fall.
Applejack and Rainbow Dash.
You know, Pinkie, these two ponies have a bit of a grudge match they're trying to settle. Trying to prove who's the most athletic.
Yes, and "grudge" rhymes with "fudge".
Yes, it... does. What?
And I like fudge. But if I eat too much fudge I get a pudge and then I can't budge.
So... no fudge?
Oh, no thanks. I had a big breakfast. Let's check in with our two competitive ponies, Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched running neck in neck. But what's this? Applejack is making a move, she's now ahead by a nose. But Rainbow Dash pulls at Applejack's have-it and takes the lead. She's ahead by half a nose. Or maybe three quarters of a nose. No, about sixty-three point seven percent of a nose... Roughly speaking. Applejack sees this move and pushes forth with her strong workhorse legs slinking ahead by three hundred and fifty noses!
Not so easy without wings, is it?
Come on, Rainbow. Show 'em a little dash.
Ho-hold your horses, Pinkie! Rainbow Dash is catching up the frontrunner Applejack!
What an upset. I thought Applejack had this in the bag.
You didn't think I was gonna let you off that easily, did you?
Whoa! I don't believe it.
I know, it's beautiful, isn't it?
Not the scenery, Twilight. Rainbow Dash just tripped me.
She did not.
She did too!
She did not, and if you slowed down and looked where you're going, like me, you'd see that you tripped over a rock.
What? Oh, hayseed! Now I got a lot of ground to make up to catch Rainbow.
Just be careful!

See you at the finish line!
I don't believe it. After a huge setback, Applejack is back at the front of the pack.
She's the head of the pack, all right. The pick of the litter! The cat's pajamas! Oh wait, why would Applejack take some poor kitty's PJs? That's not very sporting of her.
Oookay... Let's get back to the race.
Not so fast, Applejack! This race isn't over yet!
It is for you. Heh.
Whoa! Guh, I don't believe it, Applejack tripped me.
Don't you ponies ever look where you're going? You tripped on a stump. See?
Oh, I see. A big cheater is what I see.
Rainbow, Applejack would never cheat. It was just an accident.
Sure it was. I mean, yeah, I'm sure it was.
Remember, Rainbow, this is just a game.
Yes, but the rules have changed, and two can play at that game.

Welcome back, Ponyvillians, it's me, Pinkie Pie.
And Spike. Looks like Rainbow is doing her best to catch up.
I'm not sure how ketchup is going to help her in this contest. Now, in a hot dog eating contest it can make them doggies nice and slippery, but personally I prefer mustard. How about you, Spike?
Uh... I... like... pickles?
Aaand it looks like Applejack has found herself in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her.
Look, ma, no wings.
As the racers enter Equestria's Whitetail Wood, Rainbow Dash is back in the lead.
Ugh. Hey, Rainbow!

Nice one, Rainbow.
Later!

Oh my, Whitetail Wood is just lovely. Hey, Rainbow, shouldn't you be up ahead?
Except that the other racers just passed you.
Oh horse apples... See ya!

Applejack, what are you doing up here?
There aren't even any trees.
Er, no, but the sign's pointed this way... Rainbow. Mind giving me a lift?

What the hay?! You said no flying!
No, I said no wings.
I must say, Spike, that this has been the most interesting Running of the Leaves in Equestria history!
With the most interesting announcing.
But it isn't the running that's been fascinating. It's the lack of running!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Forgive me, girls. I know I'm not an athlete, but shouldn't the Running of the Leaves actually involve running?
You know, I think Twilight's right.
You do?
Yeah! If you wanna beat me, you better... RUUUN!

Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are neck in neck, jockeying for position. Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack--
Oh no, she di'int!
Oh yes, she di'id!
Cut it out!
No, you cut it out!
You started it.
And now I'm gonna finish it.
Oh no, you won't.
Oh no, you don't.
It's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash--
I won!
No, I won!
I won!
You tied!
Tied?!
For first?
For last!
LAST?
Then who won?
YOU?
Oh no, but I did get fifth place, which is rather good considering I've never run a race before.
What? How's that even possible?
You ran so slow, and looked at the scenery.
Exactly. I paced myself, just like my book said. Then at the end, when all the other ponies were worn out, I sprinted to the finish.
I don't believe it. Twilight beat us.
Well, with all your horsing around, it was quite easy.
You're right, Twilight. Our behavior was just terrible.
We weren't very good sports.
Sounds to me that an important lesson was learned.
Princess Celestia?!
W... What are you doin' here?
Fall is one of my favorite seasons, so I came to celebrate the Running of the Leaves.
I'm sorry you had to see us being such poor sport, Princess.
That's all right, Applejack. Anypony can get swept up in the excitement of competition.
It's important to remember that the friendship is always more important than the competition.
Exactly, Twilight. Now, unfortunately, because the two of you were busy tricking each other instead of shaking down leaves, many of the lovely trees of Equestria are still covered.
Why, Princess, I bet we can knock those leaves down for you lickety-split. Whaddya say, friend? Wanna go for another run?
I'd love to stretch my legs.


Oh, Opalescence. Can't you just picture it? Moi, stepping up in a stunning new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot! Why, yes! I did make it myself. Thank you so much for asking. Oh, Opal, of course you can help me. Thank you. What's that? You want to help me more! Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing? Careful now. Don't move. This shouldn't take long at all.


Howdy, Rarity!
Shh... Can't you see Rarity is trying to concentrate?
What do you think she's makin'?
Looks like a dress.
Well, that makes sense. Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.
Is there something I can help you with?
Oh, so very sorry to trouble you, Rarity, but I need a quick favor. Could you please fix the button for me? It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala.
Oh, no, no, no! You can't wear this... old thing. You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala and I'll make it for you. No problem at all. It will be my pleasure!
Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that. It would be so much work. This dress is fine.
Twilight Sparkle. I insist on making you a new dress.
But...
Not another word! I won't take no for an answer.
Well, in that case... Thank you for your generosity, Rarity. Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful.
Let me guess, Applejack. You don't want a new gown either.
Gown? Shoot. I was just gonna wear my old work duds.
You can't possibly be serious, Applejack! You absolutely must wear formal attire.
Hm... Nah.
What if I just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit?
Okay, sure. Why not? Since you're up for it and all. Just don't make them too... froufrou-y.
Deal!
Look out below!
Sorry. New trick. Didn't quite work.
Outfit for the what now?
I'll make one for you and you and all of you. Oh! And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too. Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!
What a great idea! If you're sure you can handle it.
Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business. Plus, fun!
Oh, I love fun things!
Then it's settled. We'll have a fashion show starring us.
So all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original, amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five... plus yourself, six ponies? And lickety split?
Oh, Applejack. You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.

Thread by thread, stitching it together
Twilight's dress, cutting out the pattern snip by snip
Making sure the fabric folds nicely
It's the perfect color and so hip
Always gotta keep in mind my pacing
Making sure the clothes' correctly facing
I'm stitching Twilight's dress


Yard by yard, fussing on the details
Jewel neckline, don't you know a stitch in time saves nine?
Make her something perfect to inspire
Even though she hates formal attire
Gotta mind those intimate details
Even though she's more concerned with sales
It's Applejack's new dress


Dressmaking's easy, for Pinkie Pie something pink
Fluttershy something breezy
Blend color and form,


Something brash, perhaps quite fetching
Hook and eye, couldn't you just simply die?
Making sure it fits forelock and crest
Don't forget some magic in the dress
Even though it rides high on the flank
Rainbow won't look like a tank
I'm stitching Rainbow's dress


Piece by piece, snip by snip
Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip
Thread by thread, primmed and pressed
Yard by yard, never stressed
And that's the art of the dress!

That's it. Keep them closed. Don't look. Okay, you can look now! These are your new outfits. What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack? Pretty swanky, are they not? And Twilight! I made this dress for you and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality. Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it. Oh, and it turned out BEAUTIFUL, don't you think? Ooo, and I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy. It just sings spring! And Pinkie Pie, look! Pink! Your favorite! Aren't they all amazing?
Wow... They're...
Yeah, they're...
They sure are... sumth'n.
Yes! Something.
I love something! Something is my favorite!
It's... nice.
But what's the matter? Don't you like them?
They're very nice...
And we're plum grateful 'cause you worked so hard on them.
Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining. She asked.
I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind.
That's okay. Not a problem. There's plenty more where that came from. They were only a first pass. You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied. Not to worry, I'll redo them.
Oh, Rarity. You don't have to do that. They're fine.
I want them to be better that just fine. I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
Are you sure? I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose.
Oh, it's no imposition. Really, I insist.
Well, in that case... Thank you again, Rarity.
What have I gotten myself into?

Hello? You wanted to see me, Rarity?
Fluttershy! Your new-new gown's ready. I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it. What do you think?
I... love it.
Oh, you're just saying that.
No, no. I do. It's... nice.
"Nice"?
Nice.
If you don't like it, you should just tell me.
Oh, but I do like it.
Like it or love it?
Um... both?
Which is it?
Please stop asking me this, I...
Well, just tell me what you really think.
No, that's okay...
Tell me.
No... it's fine...
Tell me!
I... like it...
Tell me, tell me, tell-me-tell-me-tell-me!

Now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate. Orion has three stars on his belt, not four.

Stitch by stitch, stitching it together
Deadline looms, don't you know the client's always right?
Even if my fabric choice was perfect
Gotta get them all done by tonight
Pinkie Pie, that color's too obtrusive
Wait until you see it in the light
I'm sewing them together!


Don't you think my gown would be more "me" with some lollipops?
Well, I think...
Balloons?
Well...
DO IT!

Hour by hour, one more change
I'm sewing them together, take great pains
Fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind
Rainbow Dash, what is on your mind?
Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time
Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine


Dressmaking's easy, every customer's call
Brings a whole new revision
Have to pick up the pace, still hold to my vision


That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor.
French haute couture, please.
Ugh...

What if it rains? Galoshes!

More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons. More candy! Oh, less candy. Oh wait, I know. Streamers!
Streamers?
Whose dress is this?
Streamers it is.

What?
Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
No, I just want my dress to be cool.
Do you not like the color?
The color's fine, just make it look cooler.
Do you not like the shape?
The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler. It needs to be about 20% cooler.

All we ever want is indecision

All we really like is what we know

Gotta balance style with adherence

Making sure we make a good appearance

Even if you simply have to fudge it

Make sure that it stays within our budget


Got to overcome intimidation
Remember, it's all in the presentation!


Piece by piece, snip by snip
Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip
Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed
Yard by yard, always stressed
And that's the art of the dress!

Oh, Opal. These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made.

Okay. I did exactly what each of you asked for. Now don't hold back. Let me know what you really think.
Oh my!
It's... perfect!
It's cool!
Why, they're the best duds I ever did see.
It's exactly what I asked for!
Thank you, Rarity.
Are you as happy with them as we are? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy. I'm just relieved to finally be done.
You are never gonna believe this! You've heard of Hoity Toity?
The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?
Uh-huh. He heard about your fashion show. Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him... He's coming here all the way from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!
Whoa, Nelly! You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy. Your business will be boomin'!
Wow!
That's so cool!
I don't believe it!
Hoity Toity? He's coming here? To see THESE dresses?
Yep! Get ready for all of your dreams to come true.

Since the beginning of time, the elite of Equestria have longed for pony fashions that truly expressed the essence of their very souls. Patiently waiting decades -- no, centuries -- for the perfect pony gown. Today, at long last, Equestria, your wait is over! Let's hear it for the breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own Rarity!
Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?
Oh dear.
You think we overdid it?
Oh, those amateurish designs look like a piled-on mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink! It's a travesty, it's what it is. Those outfits are the ugliest things I've ever seen, oh for shame. Who is responsible for subjecting our eyes to these horrors? Not to mention wasting my valuable time.
Come on out and take a bow, Rarity. You worked really hard for this. Yes! Alright, woohoo! Go, Rarity!

Rarity? You okay in there? You haven't come out for days.
You're not a laughing stock, Rarity...
She kind of is.
Shhh! Come on out and talk to us.
Leave me alone! I want to be alone! I want to wallow in... whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in! Do ponies wallow in pity? Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in! I'M SO PATHETIC!
Now what do we do?
Uh... panic?
That's your answer for everything!
Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this.
She'll become a crazy cat lady!
She only has one cat.
Give her time.

Exile... I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile. Where would I go? And what would I pack? Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing. What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile? Are you supposed to pack warm?
Huh? Opal?
Opal, how did you get up there? Hang on, you poor dear! Mama's coming!
Rainbow Dash?! How dare you strand my poor Opal in a tree?
Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you this?
We all finished your dress for you.
Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.
Do you like it?
Like it? Like it?!
Uh-uh. She doesn't like it.
No, I don't like it.
Awwww...
I LOVE IT!
Yay!
You ponies did an amazing job. It's exactly the way I imagined it.
We just followed your brilliant design.
Like we should have let you do for our outfits. Those first dresses you designed were perfect.
We're so super sorry.
You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them. We all saw how well that turned out.
Oh, I forgive you.
Well, that's mighty big of you.
But my whole career is still ruined!
Oh, right. That.
Maybe not.
All right, I haven't got all day.

Take two.
Hello... Oh, this can't be the same designer.
Simply magnificent! And I suddenly have a fierce craving for some Dutch apple pie, candied apples on a stick, apple turnovers, apple cobbler...
Brilliant!
Oh, spectacular!
Now this is a fashion show! All of these dresses are absolutely amazing. Who is responsible? Step forward, show yourself!
Brava! Brava! Magnifico! Encore!
Oh, thank you. Thank you! Oh, thank you so much!

Dear Princess Celestia,
Rarity, my congratulations to you on a most impressive fashion debut. Would you do me the great honor of allowing me to feature your couture in my Best of the Best Boutique in Canterlot?
Now, I'll need you to make a dozen of each dress for me by next Tuesday.


Tuh! Nuh! Uh! Nyuh!
Eyes over here, Spike!
Uh, sorry.
For this to work, it's crucial we keep our concentration totally on the-
Ooh!
Nyuh!
Spike! This magic needs our full attention to make it happen. There's no other way!
I can't help it. Look!
Ugh, never mind her. She's just being Pinkie Pie.
Super-extra Pinkie Pie today.
Hmm... Twitchy twitcha twitcha twitch.
Pinkie Pie? What in the wide-wide-world of Equestria are you up to?
Oh! It's my tail! It's my tail! It's a-twitch a-twitchin'! And you know what that means!
Actually, Pinkie, I haven't the slightest idea.
The twitchin' means my Pinkie Sense is telling me that stuff's gonna start falling! You should better duck for cover.
Oh, Pinkie, it's not gonna rain. Why there's barely even a cloud in the-ugh!
He just said "nice catch" in Frog.


Oh, I'm so, so sorry. You okay, Twilight Sparkle? I just couldn't stand to see the pond getting so over-populated, what with the frogs all hopping into each other and all, so I decided to fly as many as I can on over to Froggy Bottom Bogg.
Of course you did.
Um... Twilight? You gotta little somethin' on your face there.
Oh, really? Did your Pinkie Sense tell you that, too?
Nah! I could just see it. La-la-la-la-la...
C'mon, Spike, let's continue our practice session where there's a little less commotion.
Wow! That was amazing! Pinkie Pie predicted something would fall, and it did!
Oh, come on. She said that something would fall, and a frog just happened to fall right around the same time. A coincidence, nothing else to it.
My tail! My tail! Twitch-a-twitch! Twitch-a-twitch! Somethin' else is gonna fall!
Oh, Pinkie, please. Nothing else is gonna fa-AAAH!
Oh no, Twilight fell! Is it... safe to go help her?
It's okay, my tail stopped twitching. La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la...
Ha ha! That was amazing!
Oh, please.
Uh, Twilight? Why are you hanging out in a ditch?
Because, Pinkie Pie predicted it!
Honestly, Spike, she did not. Two coincidences in a row like this may be unlikely, but it's still easier to believe than twitchy tails that predict the future.
Don't worry, it's safe. Prediction already came true.
Oh, wait. Don't tell me you believe in this stuff, too?
I know it doesn't make much sense, but those of us who have been in Ponyville a while, have learned over time that, if Pinkie's-a-twichin', you better listen.
My ears are flopping! My ears are flopping!
Nyuh! What does that mean?!
I'll start a bath for you.

Phhhhft.
I get different, little, niggling feelings and they mean different things. Like when my back is itchy, it means it's my lucky day. And, when my knee gets pinchy, that means something scary's about to happen.
Is your knee pinchy now?
No, but my shoulder's achy. That means there's an alligator in the tub.
No, it's not, silly! This is my pet alligator, Gummy. He's got no teeth. See? Haha!
Okay, okay... I get it.

Well, I still don't believe all this... "special power" stuff. It's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.
What's not to believe? You do magic, what's the difference?
That's so not true, Twilight! Sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening to my body at random times that supposedly predict the future. I call 'em "combos".
Combos?
Sure! You know, like, ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. That means the sky is about to be graced with a beautiful rainbow!
Yeah, sure.
Uh-oh, I feel a combo coming on. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch!
Ugh!
Ughhh... You said that combo meant "beautiful rainbow".
Oh no-no-no-no-no. You're thinking of an ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. This was an ear flop, then eye flutter, then knee twitch. That usually means "look out for opening doors". You okay?
I don't believe this.
You don't believe because you don't understand.
Hmm...

Okay. Now when you get another twitch, we'll have all kinds of scientific information.
Okey-dokey-lokey!
Any twitches yet?
Nopey-dopey!
Now? Anything?
Wait! Hold on! Uhh, no.
Are you kidding me?! After a whole day of non-stop twitching, now that I've got you all hooked up, you're not getting a single one?
I don't control it, they just come and go.
That makes no sense!
Sometimes you just have to believe in things, even when you can't figure 'em out.
I will not believe in anything I cannot explain.
Wait, hold on, I'm feeling something...
Oh my gosh, what? What is it?!
It's my tummy! That usually means I'm hungry! Let's eat!
Pinkie? Have you seen Twilight?
Uh-huh.
Twilight? What are ya doing back there?
Rrrrgh... Did you two plan this?
Plan what?
Urgh! This is ridiculous. This can't be happening. This makes no sense. I have to figure this out.


Twilight?
Ah!
Woah-oh-uh!
Honestly, Spike, don't you know better than to sneak up on ponies?
Oh, sorry, but, um, well, isn't that what you're doing?
Pinkius-whoicus? Hh!
There's something fishy going on with the whole twitchy prediction thing, and I'm getting to the bottom of it. So, shh. Come on, Pinkius Pieicus is on the move.

Hm... Itchy nose...
A-ha, that makes no sense. See? She's hiding like something's about to fall from the sky, but a twitchy tail means something's gonna fall from the sky, not an itchy nose.
This proves...
...perhaps conclusively, that--
Gah!
Spike! Where are you going? I'm trying to teach you the value of scientific--

What's she doing now?
Smelling a flower.
Holy guacamole! I wonder what that means?
Probably that the flower smells good. Wait. I'm getting something. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch.
Hold on... You told me that's the combo that says "watch out for opening doors"!
Oh-ho. You really, really believe this stuff, don't you? Here, let me show you there's nothing to be afraid of. You see? I promise you there's nothing to fear from that-- Wo-o-ah! Ow! Ugh! Ow! Ow!
Twilight! You came to visit my new apple cellar, how nice. Twi? You okay? Uh, Twi?

Here, let me help you.
twitchy tail.
Hush, Spike! We can't let Pinkie know we're here, remember?
Something's gonna fall, something's gonna fall! Run for your lives. Ah-ha-ha!
Ugh, Spike honestly, you're overreact--
Ugh!

Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar. How 'bout you, Pinkie? Whatchu doin'?
Oh, letting Twilight secretly follow me all day without me knowing.
You mean you knew all along?! Why didn't you tell me?
Urgh!
Tail... still twitching?
All done, clear skies from here on in, as far as I can tell-- Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
Oh no! What does that one mean?
Dunno, never gotten any like it before, but whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozy. Something you never expect to happen is gonna happen! Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu hu-bu-bu-bu! And its gonna happen... at Froggy Bottom Bogg!
Oh no! Is it about her?
Uh, I'm not sure.
We better go and make sure she's okay.
Calm down, everypony. All we know right now is that Pinkie Pie just got a case of the shivers. That's all.
Guh-- Hey! I thought you didn't believe in this stuff?
I don't. I just want to be there to see the look on Pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong.
Okey-dokey!


Cold? Need a jacket or something?
So... Whadda'ya think happened to Fluttershy?
I hope nothin'.
I know, but, whadda'ya think happened?
I'm tryin' not to think about it.
Me too. But I'm thinkin' about it anyway. Like, what if she exploded?
Just exploded? For no reason?
Yeah, like boom!
Woah!
I know.
What if... What if she exploded, and then... and then exploded again!?
Can you do that? Can you explode twice?
Of course not.
But what if she exploded, and exploded again, and then-- ugh!
Will you two stop? She's fine, I'm sure of it.
I hope you're right, for Fluttershy's sake. Look! There's Froggy Bottom Bogg!

Fluttershy?
Fluttershy! You're okay!
Of course.
Phew, what a relief.
I'm so glad everything's alright.
Um... Twilight?
W-well t-then, s-see what's b-b-behind you, Twilight!
I see it... But I don't believe it!

Is that a hydra!?
Who cares? RUN!
Pinkie! Come on!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Ah!
Everypony up that hill!
He-e-elp!
Coming, Spike! Hang on!
I think we're gonna make it.
But Pinkie's still shuddering!
Oh, lookie there, it stopped. O-h-h-h, t-h-e-r-e i-t i-s a-g-a-i-n.
Ugh, he'll be up here in no time! Quick, one at a time, cross!
Nyu-uh! Uh, do you know any spells for turning a hydra into a mouse?
No.
How about a squirrel?
No!
How 'bout--
No small rodents of any kind!
That's too bad.
A hop, skip, and a... jump!
Woah-ho!
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!
He's too close. I'll distract him. You two go, now!
Oh... What would a brave pony like Rainbow Dash do? CHAAARGE!
T-t-t-twilight!
T-t-t-twilight! You have to jump!
I'll never make it!
You'll be fine!
I will not!
Its your only ho-o-ope! You have to take a leap of faith!
Y-ugh! No! Oh no! Noooo! WA-A-A-AH! Ugh! Blegh!
I knew you could do it, Twilight!
I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bogg, and I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy. I mean that hydra--
Pinkie?
That wasn't it.
Huh?
What wasn't what?
What are you talking about, Pink?
The hydra wasn't the doozy.
I'm still getting the shudders. Oo-o-oh, oo-o-oh. You see? There it is again. Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bogg, my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened.
Huh? But I-- WHAT?! The hydra wasn't the doozy?! How could it not be the doozy?! What could be doozier than that?!
Dunno, but it just wasn't it.
Give what up, Twi?
The fight. I can't fight it anymore. I don't understand how, why, or what, but Pinkie sense somehow... makes sense. I don't see how it does, but it just does. Just because I don't understand doesn't mean its not true.
Y-y-y-you m-m-mean you b-b-b-believe?
Eyup, I guess I do.
Bbrrbbrrbbrr.
What? What is?
You believing. I never expected that to happen. That was the doozy, oh and, oh what a doozy of a doozy it was! La-la-la-la-la...

Oh, good, Spike, you're here. Take a letter.
With pleasure, Twilight.
Dear Princess Celestia, I'm happy to report that-- Spike, what have I been saying about focus?
I know, but I... Well...
What's wrong, Spike, never thought you'd see me with an umbrella hat on?
Not really, no.
Pinkie's tail's a-twitchin'. What else can I do?
I am happy to report that I now realize there are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less true. It just means you have to choose to believe in them, and sometimes it takes a friend to show you the way.
Honk!
Honk.
Always your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
There it goes again.
I wonder what's gonna drop outta the sky this time?
You never know.
Twitchy tail? Holy guacamole!


Now, what have we learned?
Loss of control. 
Good.
Screaming and hollering.
Yes, and most importantly?
Passion!
Right! So now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one.
... Ugh. You're gonna cheer for me like that? Louder.
Yay.
Louder!
Yay.
LOUDER!
Ugh...
Too loud?


Yay.
Wooo.
Phase two.
Way to go.

Hehe. Sorry about that ladies. THAT was a truly feeble performance.
Actually, it wasn't all bad. I particularly liked it when you made the clouds spin.
Ugh. I'm not talking about my performance, I'm talking about yours. That feeble cheering!
What are you two arguing about?
Were we arguing? I'm sorry.
What's that?
Golly. I'd love to see you strut yer stuff in that competition.
Yeah. I wish you guys could be there. Fluttershy's a great support, but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational.
OOH! I'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom! It's like, the most coolest thing ever! Even though I've never actually seen it, but I mean COME ON! It's a sonic rainboom! How not cool could it possibly not be?!
What's a sonic rainboom?
You really need to get out more. The sonic rainboom is legendary! When a Pegasus like Rainbow Dash gets going sooo fast... BOOM! A sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once!
And Rainbow Dash here's the only pony to ever pull it off!
It was a long time ago... I was just a filly.
Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?
Are... you kidding? I'm the greatest flyer to ever come out of Cloudsdale! I could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep.
Wow. If you pull that off, you'll win the crown for sure!
The grand prize is an entire day with the Wonderbolts. A whole day of flying with my life-long heroes... It'll be a dream come true!
Yay.
I'm gonna go rest up. Don't wanna over prepare myself, y'know. Hehe. YOU, on the other hand, better keep practicing. I need a cheering section to match my spectacular performance.
She's practiced that move a hundred times, and she's never even come close to doing it. I don't know if I can cheer loud enough to help her.
Well, guess we better get this cleaned up... again.
Go on, go on.
Go on what?
Find a spell that will get us wingless ponies into Cloudsdale. Didn't you see how nervous she was?
Nervous? Have you spit yer bit or somethin'? She was tootin' her own horn louder then the brass section of a marching band!
Oh, puh-lease. I have put on enough fashion shows to recognize stage fright when I see it. We've got to find a way to be there for her. Now go on!
Owaa! Ugh. How am I supposed to find a flight spell in this mess?
A flight spell? One sec. Page twenty-seven.
How'd you do that?
It landed on my face when Rainbow Dash knocked me into the bookcase.
Here it is! A spell that will allow Earth ponies to fly for three days. Ooh, it looks really difficult... I'm not sure I can do it.
You've got to try!
Okay... But who's gonna volunteer to be the test subject?
I will! For Rainbow Dash, I will go first.
I think it worked!

You've got to learn to be assertive, Fluttershy. Don't be afraid to speak up.
Well well well. What do we have here?
It's our old friend Rainbow Crash!
Get kicked outta any flight schools lately?
I didn't get kicked out.
Face it, Rainbow Crash. Flight school had too many rules, and not enough naptimes for you.
Huh, ask her about the sonic rainboom.
That's nothing but an old mare's tale. You don't have the skills to try something like that.
Now wait just a minute! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm trying to be more assertive. Anyhow... She is going to do a sonic rainboom!
No she's not, 'cause there's no such thing!
Then show up at the Cloudeseum and see for yourself! ...If you're free.
Oh, don't worry. We'll be there!
See you then, Rainbow Crash!
Did you see that? I was so assertive!
But, Rainbow Dash. Just because you've failed the sonic rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in front of an entire stadium, full of impatient, super-critical sportsfan ponies.
Aaaaaah! What do I do?! Everypony's gonna see me fail! The Wonderbolts will never let a loser like me join. Princess Celestia will probably banish me to the Everfree Forest! My life is ruined!
Rare...
Rare?! The sonic rainboom is WAY more than rare!
Rarity?
Rarity! Are you... flying?!
I most certainly am! Aren't my wings smashing?! Twilight made them for me. I just adore them! Why so shocked? We couldn't leave our favorite flyer without a big cheering section!
"We"?.. I... I can't believe it!
It's incredible!
This is so cool! You guys made it!
Sure did!
WAIT!.. How'd you do that? Only Pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.
Haha. Pretty cool, huh?
I found a spell that makes temporary wings, but it was too difficult to do more than once. So I found an easier spell that lets the rest of us walk on clouds.
And we came to cheer you to victory!
To be honest, I was starting to get just the teeniest, tiniest bit nervous. But I feel a LOT better now that you guys are here. Hey, we've got some time before the competition. Why don't Fluttershy and I show you around Cloudsdale?
Yes!

the greatest city in the sky!
Oooh! Aaah!
Uhh... Some of the greatest Pegasi in history came from Cloudsdale!
Oh, wait for me!
Those wings are gorgeous!
Why, thank you!
Be careful with those wings, Rarity. They're made from gossamer and morning dew, and they're incredibly delicate.
Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure they can't get worn out from too much attention.
Since we're up here, I'd sure like to get a look at where the weather's made.
Great idea! C'mon, girls. To the weather factory!

This is where they make the snowflakes. Each one is hoofmade. As you can see, it's a delicate operation.
We better move on before Rarity ruins winter and causes a drought.

And here's where they make the rainbows!
Yeah, rainbows aren't really known for their flavor.
Oh, where'd you get those amazing wings? I want a pair!
Hmm... Yeah, I guess I could see that.
Oh, hey look, it's Rainbow Crash again!
Heheheyeah! Rainbow... Umm... Eyah... Crash!
Rarity! What're you doing talking to these guys?
Oh, they were just admiring my wings, Rainbow Dash.
Yeah, you should forget the sonic rainboom and just get yourself some wings like these!
Oohh...
Uhh... C'mon, girls. Why don't we go see how clouds are made? Don't listen to them. You're gonna win that competition for sure!
Are you kidding? I can't DO the sonic rainboom, and just look at these boring, plain old feathered wings. I'm doomed!

What, these old things? Go ahead, everypony. Photos are encouraged.
Rarity, we're supposed to be helping Rainbow Dash relax, remember? Put your wings away and stop showing off!
Oh, pfft. How can you ask me to put away perfection?
Waa-haa-haa!
Rainbow Dash, are you okay? You don't look so good.
Hey! There's an idea! YOU should enter the competition!
Yeah! I could watch you fly all day long!
There really isn't anypony who uses their wings quite like me. Perhaps I should compete.
WHAT?!
What am I gonna DO?! I'll never win the competition now...

I'm going to be awhile!
Fillies and gentlecolts! Please rise and join me in welcoming our beloved Princess Celestia!
the Wonderbolts!
And now, let's find out who will take the prize as this year's best young flyer!
Okay, contestant number one, you're up.
EYAH!
Okay, number two, let's go.
Umm...
C'mon, c'mon, we ain't got all day!
She's talking to you!
Oh. Umm... Oh, I guess that's me!
Okay, number four, time to go.
I'm number four, and I need just one more itsy-bitsy minute. Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hmm?
Look, I don't care who it is, but somepony's gotta go on!
Let's DO THIS!
Uhh... What am I gonna do?

I loved number seven. Doing fifteen barrel-rolls in a row can't be easy.
My favorite is number ten. She just looked like such a nice pony.
Hmm.. Wonder how come we haven't seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet. The competition's almost over.
Number fifteen, let's go!
Rarity... is ready!
Look, ladies. I don't know what to tell you. There's only time for one more performance. If you both want to compete, you'll just have to go out there together!
Well, Rainbow Dash? Shall we?
And now, for our final competitor of the day, contestant number fifteen! Uhh... And apparently contestant number four...
Good luck, Rainbow Dash. Just do your best. I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of changing our music. That "rock and roll" doesn't really match my wings.
Oof. WAAAH!
Nice work, Rainbow Crash!
Time for phase two.
Look! Phase two is working.
Oh no! Her wings evaporated into thin air!
Ooh!
Aah!
Uuh!
Hold on, Rarity! I'm coming!
Oh, I can't look!
A sonic rainboom! She did it! She did it! WOOO!
Whoa.
A sonic rainboom! Wooo! YEAH!
I did it. I did it!
Oh yeah. I did that too. Ha, best day EVER!

I want to apologize to all of you for getting so carried away with my... beautiful wings. I guess I just lost my head.
It's okay.
Oh, don't worry about it, kiddo.
We still love you.
And I'm especially sorry that I was so thoughtless as to jump into the contest at the last minute after you had worked so hard to win it. Can you ever ever forgive me?
Aw, it's okay. Everything turned out alright, right? I just wish I could have met the Wonderbolts when they were awake.
So you're the little pony who saved our lives. We really wanted to meet you, and say thanks.
Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
Princess.
Hello, Twilight Sparkle, and hello to your friends too.
Princess Celestia, I am sorry I ruined the competition. Rainbow Dash here really is the best flyer in Equestria.
I know she is, my dear. That's why, for her incredible act of bravery and her spectacular sonic rainboom, I'm presenting the grand prize for best young flyer to this year's winner, Miss Rainbow Dash!
Ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh!
So Twilight Sparkle, did you learn anything about friendship from this experience?
I did Princess, but I think Rarity learned even more than me.
I certainly did. I learned how important it is to keep your hooves on the ground, and be there for your friends.
Excellent. Well done, Rarity.
This really is the best day EVER!
Uhh, hey, Rainbow Crash.
Dash!
Oh! Uhh... Sorry. Rainbow Dash. Uhh, we just wanted to congratulate you on winning the competition.
That sonic rainboom was awesome!
Heh, thanks, guys.
Uhh, we're really sorry we gave you such a hard time before.
Aww, that's okay. Don't worry about it.
Hey. Do you want to hang out with us? Maybe you could show us how you did that incredible trick!
Sorry, boys... But I've got plans!


Where'd I put that? Ohh, I thought I already...
Ohh, and I can't forget I've got to... oh, how am I ever gonna get this done?
Are you sure I can't help? I could--
No!
Maybe just a--
No thanks!
How about--
Just stand over there.
But--
Where you'll be out of the way. Ribbon, ribbon! Where's the ribbon?!
I got it!
Whoa!
Aah!
Um, I-I'll just go and stand over there, where I'll be... out of the way.


Won't you at least let me help you clean up?
No. You've helped me quite enough.
I'm sorry, sis! I just thought that if I could help, I might find my special gift and finally earn my cutie mark.
I understand. It's just that... I need this time to fill this order without any... complications.
Okay, all done. Now, back to work. I've lost a lot of time, and I cannot have any more interruptions.
Oh, what now?!
Oh, sorry. I thought the "open" sign meant you were open, but I must have been mistaken.
No worries, Rarity. I've left her there in the basket.
Oh, she looks great! I just don't understand how you're able to do it! I can't get near her without getting a swipe from her claws.
Ahh! Did you use... the Stare on her?
Oh, no! I wouldn't! I couldn't! I-I don't really have any control over when that happens. I-It just happens. No, I'm just good with animals. It's my special gift, you know?
Well, you should have a picture of Opal as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies.
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Maybe I can be good with animals, too!
Or not.
I'm sorry I can't invite you to stay and chat, Fluttershy. I've bitten off a bit more than I can chew with this order.
But you're not eating anything.
No, Sweetie, it's an expression. It means that I've taken on more work than I can handle. I've got twenty of these special robes to make tonight! They're due in Trottingham tomorrow morning.
See? I've lined them in a special gold silk. It took so long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?
These are lovely, but twenty by tonight? How will you get it all done?
Well, I, uh...
Oh, oh, oh! Maybe I could... just... just stand over here and watch.
I'll manage.
Well, maybe I should get out of your mane so you can work.
Hi, Fluttershy! Hi, Rarity!
Hello, uh, girls ...
Hey, Sweetie Belle!
Scootaloo! Apple Bloom!
You ready for tonight?
Yup! Cutie mark planning session is a go!
Tonight is the night we each try to find our own special talent.
Even if it takes us all night!
I'm ready! You ready?
Very ready!
Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Rarity's! Yay!
And... look what I made us!
What does that patch on your cape mean?
The Cutie Mark Crusaders! Yay!
We're on a crusade, a mission!
To find our cutie marks!
Yup. And look. I lined them with this special gold silk. It took sooo long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?
Oooooh!
Sweetie Belle! What have you DONE? That was the last of the gold silk! Oh, now I'll have to make more! Oh, I hope I can make more. I'm gonna have to work all night! Which means... Sorry, girls, I'm afraid the Crusaders sleepover is cancelled.
WHAT?
I just won't have any time to watch you if I want to get these robes delivered on time.
But--
No buts this time. I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle; it's just the way it has to be.
Awwww ...
I, uh, I suppose I could take them for the night.
I couldn't ask you to do that.
Oh, it's no problem at all.
Have you met my sister and her friends? A problem is all it would be.
Did I have a problem with Opal? You've seen how well I handle small creatures!
I suppose that's true... and I do have a lot of work to do...
Come on, it'll be fun.
I assure you, they're quite a handful.
These sweet little angels?
Well... all right.
Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Fluttershy's cottage! Yay!
So cute. W-wait for me!
Hmmm...

Oh, won't this be ever so fun? We can have a nice little tea party, and braid each others' tails, and sit quietly and color, and tell each other fairy tales, and--
Hello, Fluttershy.
Oh! Hello, Twilight. Where are you off to?
I'm heading to the Everfree Forest to Zecora's to get some of my favorite tea.
Th-the Everfree Forest? Ah, you'll be careful, won't you?
Of course! How about you? What are you doing with the girls?
Rarity has a big order to fill tonight, so I volunteered to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover.
Wow. Sounds like everypony has their hooves full today. Taking care of those three fillies all by yourself? You sure you can handle it?
What? These sweet little angels? They'll be no problem at all.

Wow! Look at this place! What's that? Are those chickens?
I'm gonna get my mark first!
Girls?
Nuh-uh!
Should we--
I am!
Girls, okay, now settle--
I'm staying up all night!
Me, too!
Me, three!
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
And we want to crusade for our cutie marks!
And, and, and, we, um-- yeah! What they said!
Mmm, I don't know... how about a nice quiet little tea party?
Or... we could go adventuring in the Everfree Forest!
Yeah!
Oh, no! The Everfree Forest is much too dangerous. It's filled with far too many strange creatures.
But you could go with us and we could catch those creatures. We could be, umm... creature catchers!
YAY! Cutie Mark Crusader creature catchers!
Arrrr! I am a dangerous creature from the Everfree Forest! Rrrarr!
Halt, dangerous creature of the Everfree Forest. I am Sweetie Belle, the creature catcher, and I'm here to catch you!
You can never catch me! I am far too powerful and dangerous!
You cannot run from me!
Raaaar!
Um, oh, maybe that's not such a-- now, girls, how about we do some nice coloring? Doh--
Come back, dangerous creature, so I can catch you!
Never!
Careful... you don't...
...break anything.
Sorry, Fluttershy.
Yeah, sorry.
I guess we aren't creature catchers.
Oh, girls, it's okay. I--
I know! We could be Cutie Mark Crusader carpenters!
C-carpenters?
Hammer!
Hammer.
Hammer!
Hammer. Hammer! ...Hammer.
Um ... that doesn't look like a table.
We were making a table?
Somepony needs to put this thing out of its misery.
We are definitely not Cutie Mark Carpenters.
Who wants a picture of a hammer on their flank anyway?
Well, now that we've gotten that out of the way, how about a game?
A game?
It's called "Shhh!"
What's that?
I lose!
Me too!
Me three!
Okay, now what can we do? Oooh! How about Cutie Mark Crusader coal miners?
YEAH!
NO!
Awwww!
I mean, it's time for bed, don't you think? Aren't you excited to get all toasty and warm in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds?
Snuggly-wuggly? But we have more crusadin' to do!
We've got plans!
And capes!
Um, okay, um. Maybe the crusading can wait until morning? When it's light? And not so... dark?

How are we gonna find our special talent in our sleep?
But we're not even tired!
How about I sing you a lullaby?
Mm-hmm, yeah!

Hush now, quiet now
It's time to lay your sleepy head
Hush now, quiet now
It's time to go to bed

I know this one!
Oh, how wonderful! Why don't you sing it with me?

Hush now! Quiet now!
It's time to lay your sleepy head!
Said hush now! Quiet now!
It's time to go to bed!


Okay Sweetie, that was...

Driftin' (driftin') off to sleep!
Exciting day behind you!
Driftin' (driftin') off to sleep!
Let the joy of dream land find you!


Thank you Sweetie, um...

Hush now! Quiet now!
Lay your sleepy head!
Said hush now! Quiet now!
It's time to go to BED!


OW!

What is that?
Fluttershy, your chickens are on the loose!
I wonder what could have caused that...
Don't worry, Fluttershy, the Cutie Mark Crusaders will handle this!
Cutie Mark Crusader chicken herders! Yay!
No, I don't think that's a-- ah, come back! Please!
Come on, girls, the chickens are fine-- oh, girls, um... GIRLS!
Come on, in you go.
There's some good chickens. Okay, you three. Isn't it about time you got into bed?
BUT--
Please?

So, no more crusading for tonight, all right?
Yes, Fluttershy!
We promise, Fluttershy!
Good night, Fluttershy!
Okay, good night.
Okay, so what kind of crusading do we do next?
There's not much we can do from this room... unless we become Cutie Mark Crusader cottage cleaners.
N-no, thanks.
Well, we have to think of somethin'. We can't just waste this opportunity to find out what our special talents are. Hey, girls! Look! Some of the chickens may have escaped!
Into the forest!





Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick! Brawck, bawk-bawk-bawk, brawck!
What are you doing?
Callin' for the chicken!
That is not how you call a chicken.
Oh, and you know how to call a chicken?
I know that's not the way.
Then show me.
I don't have to show you!
You're just chicken!
Am not!
Oh, wait, now I know how to call a chicken! Scootaloo! Scoot-scootalooooo!
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.
You also forgot how to call a chicken!
Why, you...
Come on, guys, we're not gonna find the chicken or our cutie marks by arguing.
Maybe that's our special talent. Arguin'!
Is not!
Is too!
Is not!
Is too! Anything yet?
Nope.
Darn.
Heeeere, chick-chick-chick-chick, baaawk, bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk, b-baaaaawk!

Ahh! What was that?
Oh, no! If you've been turned to stone, it must mean-- oh! Oh no, the girls! Don't move; I'll be back for you. GIRLS!

Is not!
Is too!
Is not!
Is too!
Girls! Our special talent is not arguing. Besides, what would the cutie mark of somepony whose talent is arguing even look like?
Girls? Girls?
Fluttershy?
Girls! Thank goodness I found you!
Fluttershy, what--
Girls, we have to leave the forest at once!
But... we haven't found the chicken yet!
There's no time for that. There's a cockatrice on the loose!
A cocka what now?
A cockatrice! It's a frightening creature with the head of a chicken and the body of a snake. Now, come on!
The head of a chicken and the body of a snake? That doesn't sound scary, that sounds silly!
Why, if I ever saw one of them cockathingies face-to-face, I'd laugh at how silly it was.
NO! Never look one in the eye!
If you look a cockatrice in the eye--
The chicken!
Girls! Wait!
Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!
[chicken clucking
There he is!
Two chickens?
I thought only one escaped!
Grab them both!
See? Now we have to --
Girls, please. Girls-- now listen to me, girls, I-- please!
GIRLS! Behind me, NOW!
YOU! Just who do you think you are, going around turning others into stone?
You should be ashamed of yourself. I have a mind to find your mother and tell her what you've been up to, young man. Now you go over there, and turn Elizabeak and my friend Twilight back to normal, and don't ever let me catch you doing this again. Do you understand me?
Are you girls all right? I was so worried!
Yeah, fine!
Thanks to that stare of yours.
You're like the queen of stares. You're the--
Stare Master!
We're sorry we snuck out of the house and into the forest.
Yeah. We'll listen to you from now on.
We promise.
Oh, you DO, do you? Well, you better, or I'll give you... the Stare!
What... what happened?

And that's when it brought you back from stone.
This is gonna make quite a letter to the princess. I was wrong about you. You certainly do know how to handle those girls.
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.
Hmm? How so?
I assumed that I'd be just as good with kids as I am with animals. Boy, was I wrong. I really learned the hard way not to bite off more than I could chew.
You and Rarity both. Good morning, Rarity.
Did you finish all those capes?
Won't you stay for some tea?
I really must get back to the shop and clean up. Girls! Get your things. Time to go. Girls!
Girls! Time to-- Girls! Your things! Girls! It's time to-- GIRLS!
Yes, Fluttershy.
You called?
Go and get your things. Rarity is here to see you home.
Of course, Fluttershy, right away!
Ah, huh, ah, how did you... how did you do that?
I guess I'm just as good with kids as I am with animals.
Thank you, Fluttershy! Bye! Thank you, Stare Master!
Ah, uh, speaking of which, I could use your help with Opal.
Of course. How about later today?


Where are you takin' us?
We're almost there, youngin's.
I've never been here before.
Ouch!
Oh. Sorry.
Are we there yet?
There? Where? What? I don't even know what we're doing.
Here we are.
What are we lookin' at?
I have no idea.
What is that thing?
TLC as in Tender Loving Care or Totally Lost Cause?
Applejack! We're supposed to turn this into our new clubhouse?


Soup's on!
Whoa! Hi, Scootaloo! Back already? You're amazin' on that scooter.
Thanks! Wow, Apple Bloom. You did all of this?
Yep! I've fixed the broken shutters, sanded off the splinters, rebuilt the roof, painted...
That's so cool. What's Sweetie Belle up to?



There you are, Sweetie Belle! See? I told you we could find her by following her totally awesome voice.
What's that sweet tune you're singing?
Oh. I was just working on our new Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song.
COOL!
Teach us?
Well, I've only come up with one part... but okay!

They all say that you will get your mark
When the time is really right

And you know just what you're supposed to do

AND YOUR TALENT COMES TO LIGHT!


Well, uh... I'll be, Cutie Mark Crusaders. You've done one fine job with this place. So, what's next?
Well, now that we have a real life clubhouse...
...and a map of Ponyville...
...and a Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song...
Theme song?
We're gonna go out in the world and discover our talents.
A new adventure!
And earn our cutie marks.
We'll leave no stone unturned!
No mountain unclimbed!
No meal uncooked!
No sock unworn!
Well okay then! Sounds like you have a plan. I gotta, uh... Leave no apple unpicked! See y'all later!
Are we ready to get our cutie marks, ponies?
Ready!







I had nothing to do with this.
What is going on here?
Hmm... Well, we sure aren't gettin' our cutie marks for bein' librarians.
Huh. I should think not. What?
Girls, I think you're going about this the wrong way. Instead of trying to do things in areas you're not familiar with, why not try doing things in areas that you already like?
And I have the perfect place to start.
"Showcase your talents..."
"...for all to see."
"Perform in the Ponyville school talent show!"
There'll be all sorts of awards. Best dramatic performance, best comedy act, best magic act... Surely you can find your talent.
This would be the perfect place to discover our talents. Jugglin'!
Acting!
Magic tricks!
Square dancin'!
Tightrope walking!
Tiger taming!
My little ponies! You're missing the point. Think about the things you already enjoy doing. Think about what you're already good at.
Sure! We can do that.
Yeah! Sure we can.
Well, whatever we do, we'll do it as...
...The Cutie Mark Crusaders!

Sweetie Belle! I told you not to touch my things. Come back with my supplies!
We're just borrowing them for the talent show. Don't worry, sis. I promise we'll bring them back.

Thanks, Mr. Breezy. We'll return the fan to you real soon.
What do we need this fan for?
Trust me on this one.

Okay, so that's six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint, and four brushes. Anything else?
Yeah. Instructions on how to use six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint, and four brushes.

"Ghost, Goblins and Ghoulish Figures"? Good heavens, girls. What do you need a book like this for?
You'll see. Thanks, Twilight. We'll give it back as soon as we're done with it.
What do you think they're up to?
I have no idea and I don't know if I should be excited or scared to find out.

I'm glad we're doin' this as a team.
Me too. Um... so what are we doing again?
A super awesome dramatic song for the talent show, of course.
Right! With super-cool scenery. And amazing costumes!
And mind-blowin' dance moves.
This is gonna be soo amazing!
Sweetie Belle, I think you should be a singer.
What? No way I'm singing in front of a crowd. Twilight said to do something we like to do, and I'd like to be like my big sister, and she's a designer.
Fine then. You can do the costumes and the scenery.
And Scootaloo, you're great in manoeuvers on your scooter. So you should do the choreography. Y'know, all those dance moves.
Nah. I'd rather sing a wicked rock ballad. Why don't you come up with the dance routine, Apple Bloom?
Hm... I'm not much of a dancer... but I do like Kung-fu. That's kinda like dancin'. Hi-ya! Hah! Hah! Yah!
Then it's settled! Let's get started.

One... two... three... Oh! Oh!
Ow, Apple Bloom! What are you doing?
Oh, I feel like I have four left feet. I can't even spin right.
Don't be silly. You just gotta keep your head forward until very the last minute, like this. See? Easy-peasy. You just gotta practice a bunch, that's all.
Wow! That does look easy. Thanks. Okay. Let's try this again. Oh! Ouch! Ow. I'm okay!
Keep practicing!
Will do.

We fight the fight, walk the walk. Talk the talk, eat the... uh... food like a celery stalk? Ugh! I'll never come up with anything! Never, never, never!
Come back! Come back! Uh. Dumb fabric. Hey, Scoot! How's the song going?
Pbbbt.
Pbbbt? Oh my! Sounds serious.
Oh, it can't be that bad. "With our cutie marks we'll rock Equestria. We use our stomachs to... digestia"? Umm... Well... These are... um... good, but... How about after "we fight the fight"...
There is nothing that we fear
We'll have to figure out what we'll do next
Till our cutie marks are here

Wow! That's so awesome! Did you just come up with that now?
Yeah... kind of.
Thanks, I'm totally using that.
Oh no!

Ouch!
How's the spin coming along?
I think I gotta just stick to punches and kicks. You know, ponies only have four legs.
Hey, it's no big deal. Why don't you use the dress form? It'll help you with your patterns and help you put all the pieces in the right places.
Oh, is that what that's for?
Uh... maybe you should also clean your paintbrush between each color.
Oh, I was wondering why all the colors looked like mud.
You're not using power tools, are you?

The talent show is just around the corner. I wonder how the fillies are doin'.
Oh! Sorry, Scootaloo.
That's okay. Ugh!
Oops! Sorry, Scootaloo. Ouch!
Oh, my bad, Sweetie Belle. Let's sing the chorus again!
Well, gosh. Sure wasn't expectin' that.
I think that sounded pretty good.
Me too. You think we're ready?
Ready as we'll ever be. Hey! Did you see us practicing?
Uh... Yeah.
Well? How'd we do? How'd we do?
Uh...
Speechless! See, girls? I told you that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna leave them speechless.
YAY!
"Speechless" is right.

...And on the count of three, this rabbit will disappear, and something tasty will reappear in its place. A one, a two, and a three! Hey! Where are they? Snails, where are the... carrots. SNAILS!
Uh, how about a round of applause for the S&amp;S magic act? Now for our next act, we have Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie reciting their favorite poem... on roller skates!
Break a leg!
Sweetie Belle! What a thing to say!
No, no, no. You see, in the theater it's considered bad luck to say "good luck". So you say "break a leg" instead.
My little ponies! How are you doing?
Nervous...
Don't worry. You're gonna be amazing. Remember, just stick to what you know best. I can't wait to hear you sing, Sweetie Belle.
Why does everypony always think I'm gonna sing?
Actually, Twilight Sparkle, I'm the main singer tonight.
Oh?
And I'm the main dancer. Hi-ya!
Oh?
And I'm in charge of...
Costumes?
And sets and props. How'd you know?
Really, girls? Are you sure...?
Cutie Mark Crusaders, you're on next. Break a leg.
Break a le...
Ugh!
Uh... good luck!

Look, here, are three little ponies,
Ready to sing for this crowd,
Listen up, 'cause here's our story
I'm gonna sing it


Very loud!!!!!!!


When you're a younger pony
And your flank is very bare
Feels like the sun will never come
When your cutie mark's not there


So the three of us will fight the fight
There is nothing that we fear
We'll have to figure out what we'll do next


Till our cutie marks are here!


We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
On a quest to find out who we are
And we will never stop the journey
Not until we have our cutie marks


They all say that you'll get your mark
When the time is really right
And you know just what you're supposed to do
And your talent comes to light


But it's not as easy as it sounds
And that waiting's hard to do
So we test our talents everywhere


Until our face is blue


We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
On a quest to find out who we are
And we will never stop the journey
Not until we have our cutie marks


We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
On a quest to find out who we are
And we will never stop the journey
Not until we have our cutie marks!!


Wow. That did not go as well as I expected.
I can't believe they're laughin' at us.
Was it that bad?
Back on stage, girls. It's time for the awards.
Back on stage? No.
They'll just laugh some more.
Yeah, what's the point?
Now girls, let's be good sports. You made a great effort. You should be proud. Now come on!
Let's hear it for all our talented fillies and colts.
Our first award goes to... Snips and Snails for best magic act.
Hey! Mine's at least shinier.
Well, mine's bigger.
Oh yeah, well... Well, mine is, um... heavier?
The next award goes to... Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie for best dramatic performance.
And finally, the last award of the night goes to... the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
What?
For best comedy act.

Can you believe it? We won!
I knew our act was awesome.
You know what would be the best? If we won and we got our cutie marks.
Congratulations, ponies! Job well done.
Hey, you don't sound too excited.
Which is the prize we really wanted.
Oh, girls...
But we think we know why.
Yes. We know why.
Oh? Tell me. I'd love to make a special report to the Princess.
Well, maybe we were trying too hard.
Yes? And?
And instead of forcing ourselves to do something that's not meant for us...
Yes? Yes?
We each should be embracing our true talent!
And that is...?
Comedy!
Apple Bloom! You did it!
Did you see our award? Weren't we funny?


Perfect!
Good afternoon, Miss Rarity!
You yah... Y-y-you know my name?
Well, of course I do, darling. I make it a point to know all of the up-and-coming designers and Clothes Horse magazine simply raved about you.
Oh my stars. If I'm dreaming, do not wake me up. How may I help you, Miss Shores?
Oh please, call me Sapphire.
Well, as I'm sure you know, I'll be touring all of Equestria with my latest concert, Sapphire Shores' Ziegfilly Follies, so I need to look seeensational! Ow!
I have just what you need. Sapphire Shores, prepare yourself for the pièce de résistance de la haute couture. I used every last diamond I found on this one garment.
Really?
Oh yes, and five more, each done up in a different jewel.
Beg pardon?
Costume changes.


Oh my gosh! Sapphire Shores! The pony of pop! She is awesome! I mean, she's gorgeous and talented and-heh... and not even half the pony you are. I mean, you're ten times more gorgeous and talented and-
Spike, a lady is never jealous.
Eh, of course not. But were you totally flipping out or what?!
Ladies do not "flip out", Spike. However, I was quite in awe. Oh, I need to find more jewels than ever before to decorate her costumes. Oh, aha!
Did you find some?
Yes, Spike! Right there!
Ooooo! You look so delicious...
Spike! I promised I'd give you gems to snack on, but we need to collect more first or I'll never be able to make these outfits for Sapphire.
Hm... I will miss you, my sweets.
Come along, Spike. We have many jewels to find.
At your service, milady.

Spike!


You've been very patient today, Spike. And for that you get the finest reward. This is from me to you.
Is something wrong, Spike?
No. It's perfect.
Ooo, bring the cart, Spike. There are more over here.
For me. From Rarity.

Yesss, gemsss. Gemsss!
Where?
Preciousss gemsss! He is the gem hunter. With him we can have all those gems... and more! Let's get the dragon.
Spike! Where are you?
Wait! Who is that?
You know, it's terrible to keep a lady waiting.
Coming!
Jackpot!
Oh, it's not the dragon we want. It's the pony!
The pony...
Well, Spike, I think that's all we can do for today. And these will certainly get me well on my way with Sapphire's outfits. Why don't we start headi... Oh! What's this? Another jewel. Oh.. Oh, strange. It's in the trees. Oooo... Ewww! Uh... uh... Good day, gentle... uh, fellow. Uh, I am Rarity and this is my friend Spike.
Ehe...
And you are...
A Diamond Dog.
Yes. We hunt.
Uh... we?
We hunt for gems. But you are a better hunter. So now we hunt... for you!
Yaaaaah!
Ooooooh!
Yaaaaah!
Spike! Come on! Hurry!
Gotcha!
Waah! Spike!
Got him, Rarity! I got him!
Haha! Nope!
Sorry, scaly one.
Wait! Rarity?
Unhand me this instant, you ruffians. Stop! Put me down, you thugs! You brutes!
Spike! Ah, dirt! Aaaaah, Spiiiike!
Which, what, where?
Save me...!
Nooooooooooo!!!

Spike, can you breathe now?
Good. Now tell us what you know.
Yeah. 'Cause all you said earlier was...


Not a whole lot to go on there, sport.
Sorry. Rarity and I were in the woods looking for jewels when these creepy guys showed up.
Creepy guys?
They called themselves the Diamond Dogs. They grabbed Rarity and disappeared down a hole in the ground.
Well, this sounds mighty easy. Just take us to that there hole and we'll save Rarity.
Holy moly, that's a lotta holeys.
Come on, girls! Let's get started.
Hello?
Yuck! Ugh!
Puh!
Quick! We gotta get down one before they're all filled up.
Oh! Oh my. Oh, oh!
We can't muscle through it!
Whew. Heavens to Betsy. Now I'm used to pickin' myself up and dustin' myself off, but Rarity won't even touch mud 'less it's imported.
Oh, Rarity...

Oh, woe is me! What ever shall I do? Ah! Dirt, dirt! Get away, dirt! Oh! Make it stop, make it stop! Ah! Filthy, disgusting dirt. It stings, it burns. Help! Oh, somepony save me, save me!

We gotta save her.
But they blocked up all the holes.
Don't mean we can't dig 'em out. Come on!
Ow!
Oof!
Get 'em!
Whoooaaa!
Come on!
All those scary monsters popping up everywhere. Oh, poor Rarity must be terrified.

Give me the baubles!
Ah!
Give me the beads!
Aah!
Where are the trinkets?!
Aaaah!
Where is the treasure?!

Poor Rarity. What are we gonna do?
I got it! I'll save you, my sweet.
Huh?

Spike, it is very noble of you...
Shhh!
Oh, Lady Rarity. My damsel in distress.

I shall save you. Show yourselves, you dogs! You curs! Ah. There you are, you mangy mutts.
Now, where is Lady Rarity?
Nothing could stop me, milady.
Mmmmmm...

Hoho there, lover boy.
Whoa! Whoa whoa whoawhoawhoa... I got a bite! I got a bite!
Hold on there, little fella.
Applejack!
Twilight!
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness...
Wait for me!
Oh!
Whee!
Whee! Ha, ha, ha!
Oh, oh!
Ha ha, it worked! We're in! Now we can finally save Rarity!
Um... Which way do we go?
Nooooooooooo!

All these tunnels... How are we ever gonna find Rarity?
Guess we're just gonna have to start going down them one by one.
That could take forever! There's gotta be way to narrow it down.
I know! I bet they've taken Rarity down the tunnel with the most gems.
But Spike, Rarity is the only one who knows how to find gems.
No, Twilight. You can! You can copy Rarity's gem-finding spell.
Oh my gosh! You're right! Rarity showed me how she did it a while back. If I can just remember...
That's it. You did it, Twilight! Come on! We're coming, Rarity. We'll save you. Just hold on.

Oh please, Diamond Dogs. Please let me go.
No!
You're our precious little pony.
Forever! Muhahahaha!
But what ever do you want from me?
Gemsss!
Yes! The gems. The jewels.
Find them! Find them all!
Oh! Is that all?
There. A lovely pocket of jewels are right there. Now, if you'd be so kind as to show me the exit?
What? But you said you wanted me to find the gems.
Yes! Find and then dig.
Dig?
Yes. Dig.
What are you doing? We said dig!
Oh, for goodness. Fine! Just stop. Stop! Dig, dogs! Dig! And fast.
She won't dig, she pulls.
I beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?
Others will dig. You will haul the wagon.
Prrrecious pony-pedi will be preserved.
Well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care. When was the last time you two had a manicure? You're scratching up my coat with those jagged things!
Please be quiet!
Good heavens, what is that smell?
Smeeeeeell?
Ah, mystery solved. It's your breath.
Enough! Search, pony!
Well, since you insist... But I must say the working conditions in here are simply dreadful. Musty and damp, it's going to wreak havoc on my mane. And this air is stifling, suffocating. And when I try to take a deep breath, the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseated.
You look and smell like you haven't bathed in weeks. Have you never heard of soap? You could all do with a good round of soap and water. Oh water, oh water, I'm terribly thirsty. Could I please have some water?
Good gracious, I can't take this anymore. Be quiet, pony!
And that's another thing. I would appreciate if you stopped calling me "pony". I am a lady and I wish to be addressed as such. So you may call me "Miss" or "Rarity" or "Miss Rarity".
Enough! Your whining! It-it-it hurts!
Whining? I am not whining. I am complaining. Do you want to hear whining? Thiiis iiis whiiining! Oooh, this harness is too tiiight! It's going to chafe. Can't you loosen it? Oooh, it hurts and it's sooo ruuusty! Why didn't you clean it first? It's gonna leave a staaain! And the wagon's getting heeeavy, why do I have to pull it?!
Aaah! Make it stop!
Stop whining!
But I thought you wanted whiiining!
Geh! We'll do anything, pony!

Yes, yes, I know. This is ridiculous! Letting a pony order us around. What are we? Mice or dogs?
Mi... dogs?
Dogs do not pull. Ponies pull. Let her make the awful noises.
Ha! Make the noises all you want. But move while you make them. Hyah, mule!
Did you just call me a... mule?
Ehh...
What are these noises?
He called me ugly!
No! Mule! I said mule!
An old ugly mule! And it's true! Just look at me. I used to be beautiful, but, but nooow...
No, no! You're still beautiful, po... uh, Miss Rarity.
You're just saying that!
No, you're still pretty and... and...
Oh, uh, uh, nice. Yeah.
Oh, I've had just about enough of this!

We're getting close. I can feel it.
It's coming from down here. Come on!
She must be in there. Let's go!
More workhorses.
Hoh, doggies. If you can take this bull by the horns, you better be ready for a ride. Come on, ponies! Kick 'em up, kick 'em out. Buck 'em up, buck 'em down.
Yeehaw! Get along, little doggies!
I'm coming for you, milady. Hi-ho, Twilight! Away!
And just what do you think you're doing?
Please, Twilight. Just give me this.
Lady Rarity, I'm here to save you!
Excuse me?
So picky.
And critical.
She won't stop talking.
And crying.
We, uh, give her back. Yes.
Rarity! You're safe!
Why, yes. Hello, girls. You arrived just in time to assist me.
Assist you with what?
With those.
You're letting her leave with all these... jewels?
Yes. Take them. And her with them.
Please!

I can't believe you found all these gems!
Heh. I can't believe you tricked all those dogs.
Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean I cannot handle myself in a sticky situation. I had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time.
I can't wait to write to Princess Celestia to tell her what you taught me today.
Me? What did I teach you?
Just because somepony is ladylike doesn't make her weak. In fact, by using her wits a seemingly defenseless pony can be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all.
Hm... "Outshines" is right. Now you have enough gems to cover Sapphire Shores's costumes.
Not if you eat them all, Spike.


So sorry, Fluttershy. I hate being late for our weekly get-together. The usual!
But you will not believe what happened to me.
Is everything all right?
Oh, it's much more than all right. I was on my way here, wearing my latest hat creation, when who should stop me on the street but Photo Finish!?
Photo Finish?
She is the most famous fashion photographer in all of Equestria. Anywho, she saw my hat and said it was absolutely marvelous!
What a lovely compliment.
She was so impressed that she wants to take some pictures of my shop featuring some of my clothes!
Oh, Rarity, I'm so happy for you.
But I'm going to need somepony fabulous to model for me. Somepony with beauty. Somepony with grace. Somepony... like you?
Oh, goodness. I don't know.
Oh, this is such a huge opportunity. And it would mean so much to me.
I'm flattered, really.
Nopony is going to have your elegance and poise.
But...
Nopony!
There has to be somepony more quali...
Please!
Somepony more into fashion.
Please!
Somepony more comfortable in the spotlight.
Please, please, PLEEEASE!
Oh, if it's that important to you, of course I'll do it.
Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou! You are the best friend a pony could ever have!
Isn't it? Though I was so afraid you wouldn't agree to model for me that I felt completely frazzled. I think I feel a pimple coming on. Oh! Only one solution!
The usual!


Hm... She's going to want to see attitude and pizzazz.
A-a-attitude and, um... pizzazz.
More light! It has to catch the sequins just so or the whole outfit is just a disaster. Oh, and the headdress need more feathers. Pinkie Pie! More feathers! And sequins! More sequins!
And more ribbon! Oh no! Less ribbon. No! More ribbon.
Oh, this hem is completely off. PINCUSHION! Thank you all for helping me. I'm sorry to be so short with you, but I'm... I'm just so nervous.
Oh, doesn't that hurt?
Thick scales. Can't feel a thing. And even if I could, there is no pain that would keep me from assisting the most beautiful creature in the world. I'm gonna tell you two a secret. But you have to promise not to tell anyone.
I promise.
Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.
I have a crush on Rarity!
Give me a break. Everypony already knows how you...
Twilight! You promised Spike you wouldn't say anything. He trusts you. And losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend forever!
But...
FOREVER!
My lips are sealed. Though I'm pretty sure Rarity is gonna pick up on your feelings.
I, Photo Finish... have arrived.
Let me just say, what an honor!
We begin... NOW!
Attitude and pizzazz!
Yes! Show Photo Finish something. No! Yeees. No! Yeees. No! Yeees. ENOUGH!
She hardly took any pictures.
I'm so sorry. I tried my best.
Well, the headdress is too big for you and cape had too much sparkle. I can't believe I ever thought I could impress her.
It seems that I, Photo Finish, have found the next fashion star here in Ponyville.
Really?
Did you hear that? I am going to "shine all over Equestria".
Oh, Rarity. I was so worried I'd ruined everything.

No, no, no, yes! That is definitely the one. Photo Finish is going to love it. Everypony is going to love it!
Oh, I am so excited for you. Just don't forget us little ponies when you become the most famous designer in all of Equestria.
Never.
Put me down here. Oh, nonononononono. The model should be in something simple! Something inspired by... the nature!
That's just what I was thinking. Um... give me a moment and I'll, uh, put a little something together.
Yes... that will not be necessary.
But... but... how are you going to help me "shine across Equestria" if I don't design something new for these pictures?
I am not going to help you shine across Equestria. I am going to help her shine. She is my star. You! Go!

I can't, Rarity.
Oh, but you must, Fluttershy. Photo Finish wants to make you a star. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. I know we were both hoping it would be my lifetime, but nonetheless you can't throw away this chance. You must do this for me. You must. You must! YOU MUST!
Floottershy! It is time to make... the magics! Oh, wunderbar! You are like a delicate flower. So much more alluring without all those sparkles und feathers.

How'd it go? How'd it go?
It didn't. Photo Finish wanted to work with Fluttershy, not me.
Oh, Rarity. I'm so sorry. Is there anything we can do?
I just vant to be alone right now.
You heard her. She vants to be... alone. What? I didn't think she meant alone alone.

Too much blush. Not enough. Too much. Not enough. Perfect.
Oh, yes! Even her schneezes are graceful. NOW GO! How do you feel? Excited? Overjoyed? Thrilled beyond your wildest dreams?
N... nervous.
Nervous? Dun be ridiculous. You're only facing a large crowd of ponies who will be watching your every move and silently judging you.
Your cue! Now go!
No seriously...
You can't let Rarity down. You must do this. You must. You must. You must.
So graceful.
So lovely.
So perfect for my new advertisement.


It's Fluttershy!

Wow. Look how popular you are. I'm so excited for you. You must be having the best time ever.
Oh, yes. Best time ever...
Floottershy! I have been looking for you everywhere. We have the thing at the place.
I'll see you at the spa? Our usual time?
Of course! I can't wait to hear all about the... "thing at the place".
I'm the one who should be mobbed by strangers wherever I go.
Welcome to Carousel Boutique!
Is she still here? We heard Fluttershy was here.
Sorry. You just missed her. But you're still in luck. I'm having a huge sale of some of my best designs.
And you are...?
Rarity, of course.
Never heard of you.

Obviously I, Photo Finish, am thwilled to have found her.
Photo Finish?
She's a natural in front of the camera.
Um... Photo Finish?
I only need to point and shoot, and I capture... the magics!
Photo Finish, I'm so sorry to interrupt. It's just that I'm running late.
Oh, actually I'm supposed to be meeting my friend...
WE GO!

My hooves are getting positively pruney, I've been waiting here so long. Obviously Fluttershy's just too busy with her new career to spend time with her best friend.
I'm sure she just got tied up.
Of course she did. She's a big bright shining star! I wish that star would burn out.
Rarity! Fluttershy is your friend.
I know, I know. And I should be happy for her, but instead I'm just... jealous! Oh, please promise you won't tell her I feel this way. Please, please, pleasepleasePLEASE!
You have my word. Losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend.
FOREVER!
Wow! You look great!
Fluttershy may be the one who's famous, but that doesn't mean I have to stop looking fabulous.
Rarity! I'm so sorry I'm... Oh no. She's already gone, isn't she?
Sorry.
Feel better?
No. Can I tell you something?
Of course.
You promise not to tell Rarity?
I swear.
Pinkie Pie Swear?
Oh, really? Well... If you wanna know the truth, Rarity...
Oh, what were you about to say?
Nothing!

I was just thinking. If you really don't like being a model, you could always quit.
Oh, no. I could never do such a thing. Rarity would be devastated.
Uhhhhhh!
Oh, if only all these ponies didn't like me so much. Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore. She'd find somepony else with... the magic!
It's Fluttershy!

Don't you see? On her own, Fluttershy could never do something unattractive. But if I used my magic to help her do something unattractive at her next fashion show, no one will ever want her to model again. And if Fluttershy no longer has to be a model, Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her. And I'll no longer have to keep their secrets! It's the perfect plan! You can't tell anyone about it. Promise me you won't tell anyone?
So you do promise or you don't?
Uh, yes! Obviously, that's why I zipped my mouth closed, then locked it with a key, then dug a hole, then buried the key, then built a house up top the hole where I buried the key, then moved into the house on top of the hole.
Obviously.

You really think it'll work?
They love you for being you. So all I have to do is make you not be you. Just leave it to me.
Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about.
Oof!
Oh no.
Get her off the stage!
She's an embarrassment to all things fashion!
I, Photo Finish, have made a terrible mistake!
Bravo! I say bravo!
Bravo? Who could possibly say bravo to that horrid display?
Such attitude! Such pizzazz! She's invented an entirely new kind of modeling! Bravo!
Who is saying these things?
It's her. The unicorn in the gorgeous cape and headdress.
Now that is a pony who clearly knows a thing or two about fashion. Well, if that fabulous pony likes it, then I do too! Bravo!

This is awful. Just awful! Somehow I've become more popular than ever. Oh, I'm so frustrated I could just kick something!
If only Rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly.
Ugh! But Rarity...!
Fluttershy! Are you all right?
I'm great! I'm a super famous fashion model. Why wouldn't I be great?
Because you ha...!
Out there on the runway, everyone was turning on you and... Oh... Oh, Fluttershy. It's so awful. I wanted them to.
You did?!
Of course she did! Because...!
I'm jealous! I wanted all the attention. And instead it was going to you. I even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over. But then, when it started happening, all I could think was how could I want you to fail at something you love so much?
But... Fluttershy doesn't... Ugh!
Love? Oh, Rarity. I hate being a model.
You do?
More than anything.
Then why did you keep doing it?
I was afraid if I quit, you'd be mad at me for not wanting to... "shine all over Equestria".
And I thought if I told you how jealous I was of your success, you'd think I was a terrible friend.
Never!
All this time!
If we just told each other the truth.
I promise never to keep my feelings in secret again.
Me too.
You were brilliant. Brilliant! I've already got six photo shoots lined up for tomorrow alone.
I'm sorry, Photo Finish, but I don't think I'll be able to make any of them.
Whaaat?
We go!
Vat has just happened?
Spike has a crush on Rarity!

Now this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
Isn't it, though?
Dear Princess Celestia,
Being a good friend means being able to keep a secret. But you should never be afraid to share your true feelings with a good friend. Did you get all that, Spike?
No. I did not. I still can't believe you told someone about my secret feelings for Rarity.
You're right. That was wrong of me, and I'm very sorry.
Apology accepted.
Now will you take down my letter to Princess Celestia?
I would love to. But... I'm a little busy at the moment.


And that's when the yellow birdie thought to himself, "Hmm. My favorite little tree isn't such a little tree anymore." So she sang her song, big and strong, and they all lived in that great, big tree happily ever after. The... end.
Applejack! Were you reading a bedtime story to... an apple tree?
Heh... uh... Well, ya know, bein' replanted in a whole new place is very upsettin' for a tree... and Bloomberg here is one of my favorites.
No fair, Applejack! You've got a luxurious, private sleeper car for a tree, while I am crowded and cramped in the same car with all the other ponies. How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?!
But Bloomberg's the whole reason we're makin' this trip. He needs his rest so we can give him as a gift to my relatives in Appleloosa.
Hmph! You talk about it as if it's your baby or something.
Who you callin' a baby?! Bloomberg's no baby! Don't wet widdle Rarity make you all saddy-waddy. Bloomberg's a big and strong apple tree. Yes, he is. A-coochie-coochie-coo-coo-coo!
It's widdle Rarity who's all "saddy-waddy"! Urgh!


Oh man, we're going fast! This is so exciting I can't even wait!
Oh my gosh!
Uh, speaking of, some of these popcorn kernels didn't get popped.
Okay, fine...
Ghk...
Good night!
Uhh... maybe it's time we all got a little shut-eye. We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
Awwww!
What's going on?
Rainbow Dash thinks Fluttershy's a tree!
Did you say she was a tree?
Ya know she's not a tree, right?
She's not a tree, Dashie!
I'd like to be a tree...
Oh, for Pete's sake!
Well that was kind of huffy.
Huffy the magic dragon!
Would you all be QUIET... NOOOOW!!!???



A buffalo stampede!
I just love their accessories!
They're getting awfully close to the train.
I want to speak to the manager!
Oooh, looky! Now they're doing TRICKS! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Now do a back-flip!... Or... Just jump?
Hmm.. Something tells me this isn't a circus act. Hey there!
Where ya headed in such a hurry? Wow, you're pretty quick for someone so... bulky. No offense.
Huh..?
Heeeelp!
And Spike!
Ugggh..
Dragon-napping Spike. I'll show her! Ow...

Hey there! Welcome ta A-a-pplelooosa!
Braeburn, listen–
Cousin Applejack, mind yer manners, you have yet ta introduce me to your compadres! Shame on you!
Braeburn, listen, somethin' terrible's happened–
Terrible is right, your train is full seven minutes late! That's seven minutes less for you to delight in the pleasures and wonders of... A-a-a-pplelooosa! Boggles the mind, we settler ponies built all this in just the past year, don't it?! And as you can see, we have all of the finest comforts. Like horse-drawn carriages!
Okay, you pull now.
Aww, we just switched.
And those there are horse-drawn, horse-drawn carriages.
...Listen, Braeburn, I– Oof!
And here's our local waterin' hole, the Salt Block.
That's enough salt for you!
Can't I at least... get a glass of water?
Over there's the office of Sheriff Silverstar. And here's where we have our wild west dances! And here's where we have our mild west dances!
But, Braeburn, we–
And here's the most wonderful sight in all of... A-a-a-pplelooosa! Our apple orchard.
Braeburn!
First harvest should be any day now.
Braebu–
Good thing too!
Brae–
'Cause we need that grub to live on.
BRAEBURN!
Uh, yes, cuz?
You have a very nice town an' all, but but we have a HU-UGE problem! Some of our friends are missin'!
A stampede of buffalo.
They took Spike!
Rainbow Dash went after them!
And we can't find Pinkie Pie.
And we had an apple tree with us for your orchard, but they took that too!
But why?
Beats me. We put a lot of hard work into this land, so we can feed our town, our families, our foals! And now they're sayin' all these trees have to go? T'ain't fair...

Ooh, I can't wait to get my hooves on that little buffalo... Hnnh... Ow! Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash and gets away with it.
Boo!
Yah! ...Pinkie Pie!
Ah, ya caught me! Looks like I tricked you and didn't get away with it either! You're good.
Shhshh! What do you think you're doing?! You gotta get out of here!
I do?
You're gonna blow my cover.
I am?
I'm trying to save Spike!
Oh my gosh! So am I!
And the more of us there are out here, the more chances of us getting... caught. Run, Pinkie, I'll hold 'em off. Save yourself!
Stop! Dash, Pinkie, 'sup? Hey, no worries I know those guys. They're cool.
If you say so, Spike. Catch ya later, bro.

Seems they took me by mistake. And they feel awful about it too, poor guys. Fortunately, they totally respect dragons, so they treat me like an honored guest.
Still don't like ponies much, though... But you're with me, so it's cool.
Huh.. Well, I still don't trust them. I say we turn tail and bail while we still–
Certainly. And, Mr. Spike, you like gemstones, yes?
You!
You!
That's it! We are outta here!
Wait! Please accept my apologies for what happened on the train. We didn't mean for anyone to be hurt.
Yeah, right.
We only wanted the tree. The settler ponies have overtaken the land and have planted an orchard all over it! Because of their thoughtlessness, we can no longer run over our traditional stampeding grounds.
Huh?
I think it's time they met Chief Thunderhooves.

I think they get the idea, Chief.
They planted apple trees all over it without asking our permission.
Well that's not very nice. Right, Rainbow Dash?
Hmph...
The ponies refused to move their trees, so we are stuck here, and it is not fair!
See, Rainbow Dash? They had a good reason to–
Huh... Ah!
I'll say they had a good reason! C'mon. We have some apple-pickin' Appleloosans to talk to!

Sorry, Rarity, but our friends are out there and we have ta' be ready for a long hike into buffalo territory if we're gonna save 'em! Let's go!
Hi, guys!
Pinkie! We're so glad you're safe.
How did you escape from the buffalo?
We didn't!
We promised the buffalo a chance to talk.
Oh, yeah? 'Bout what?
We brought our new pal Little Strongheart here to explain to the Appleloosans why they should move the apple trees off buffalo land.
That information would be quite help–
That's weird. 'Cause my cousin Braeburn here wants to explain to the buffalo why they should let the apple trees stay.
That would be a useful thing to–
The land is theirs! You planted the trees not knowing that. Honest mistake. Now, you just gotta move 'em, that's all.
Well... heh...
They busted their rumps here! An' now they're supposed ta bust their rumps again, just 'cause some buffalo won't stampede someplace else?
Plant the trees somewhere else!
Where?! It's the only flatland around these parts!
The BUFFALO had it FIRST!
The settler ponies need it to LIVE!
Come ON, Applejack!
Look! Both the settlers and the buffalo have good reasons to use this land. There must be something we can do.
Hey! I've got an idea!


We may be divided
But of you all, I beg
To remember we're all hoofed
At the end of each leg


No matter what the issue
Come from wherever you please
All this fighting gets you nothing
But hoof and mouth disease


Arguing's not the way
Hey, come out and play!
It's a shiny, new day
So, what do you say?


You gotta share
You gotta care
It's the right thing to do
You gotta share
You gotta care
And there'll always be a way through


Both our diets, I should mention
Are completely vegetarian
We all eat hay and oats
Why be at each other's throat?


You gotta share
You gotta care
It's the right thing to do
And there'll always be a way
Throoooough!

It appears that Sheriff Silverstar and I have come to... an agreement.
We have.
That was the worst performance we've ever seen.
Teh... Abso-tively!
The time for action... Hmh... is upon us! Our stampede will start at high noon tomorrow. And if the orchard is still there, we'll flatten IT! AND the whole town!
But, Chief!
An' we Appleloosans say you'd better bring yer best, 'cause we'll be ready and waitin'.
But, Sheriff...
Oh... That wasn't the message of my song at all...

I want my kin ta' have what they need to live... but a storm's a-brewin' here. And I don't like the look of it.
We've just got to talk some sense into them before somepony gets hurt. Listen, maybe if you would just reconsider, we–
About the trees. Now if you could–

If we could just sit down and talk we could–
Grrrrr!

Sheriff, if we could only–

Isn't there someway to stop this?
Unless the settlers remove those trees, I do not think so.
I know you don't want to do this.
But they have taken our land. What would you have me do, Rainbow Dash?
I don't know... but it's never too late to think of something.
At noon, it will be too late.

Come on, THINK. Think, think, think, think, think, think, think!

–whaddaya say?
You got to share
You got to care
It's the right thing to do

Grrr...
You got to share

CHAAARGE!
You got to care

Wah-ahh! Woah-oo-oo-oo-ooah!

Ready... aim... fire!
Ah! Aah!
Yum! Hey, I've got a much better idea!

We... will allow the apple orchard to stay in exchange for a share of its fruit, heh... Those... delicious apple pies!
Bloomberg, this is yer special day. Mama's so proud of you!

Dear Princess Celestia,
Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing. Even the worst of enemies can become friends. You need understanding and compromise. You've got to share. You've got to care.

HEY! That's what I said!


There you go, Mr. Mousey. Now you stay off that leg and do everything I told you. And it will be just like new in no time at all.
Oh, you're welcome. Happy to be able to help.
You... found a watch? You... wanna be a watch? You're running! Running out of time? No. You're... late?
Aah! It's starting! I'm missing it!
Oh, thanks, Angel. I mean, if you hadn't reminded me, I might have not remembered, and then I wouldn't be there, and everypony would be wondering where I was and... Oh, right. I'm late.
Oh, okay then. See you later.


Halt!
Who goes there?
It's all right, sirs. She's on the list.
Thanks, Twilight.
I'm so glad you could make it, Fluttershy. It wouldn't be the same without you.
How's everypony doing? Good? Good.
Anything else we can get for you, dearies...? Ooh, I-I mean, esteemed guests.
Everything is fine, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.
Sorry I'm late. I had to finish taking care of a patient first.
Oh, you and your tender loving care of little animals. I just know Princess Celestia is gonna love that about you. I mean, I hope she will... I mean, of course she will!
Wow, Twilight. I thought I was the only one who got nervous at social gatherings.
Oh, it's not that. I just want the princess to approve of my friends.
But she's met us all before.
And read about you in my letters. But this is the first time she's spent any real time with you. I want everypony to make a good impression.
Well, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?
Don't touch me! Watch the dress! Careful, you're gonna spill that on me! Oh, oh, that looks delicious. What is it? Oh, does it stain?! Keep it away from me!
Or... perhaps not that casual.
Uh... which is the salad and which is the appetizer again? And which am I supposed to eat first? Oh, never mind. I'm not hungry.
It's okay, Twilight. So our friends' manners aren't perfect. I doubt the princess will even notice.
Hey!
A thousand pardons, Your Majesty.
Empty teacup at 4 o'clock!
Uh, I see it, honey bun!
Oh, um... thank you.
Not at all, Your Highness.
Oh, but of course, Your Majesty.
Oh...
And what about you, dear? Fluttershy, is it?
Me? Oh yes, Your Highness.
I understand from Twilight Sparkle's letters that you enjoy tending to the needs of woodland creatures.
Yes, I love to take care of animals.
As do I. As Princess, I care deeply about all creatures, great and small.
Nothing means more to me than the well-being of all my subjects.
Ah, Philomena, my pet. You're awake. Do say hello to our gracious hosts.
Oh... my.
She is quite a sight, isn't she?
I... I... I've never seen anything like it.
Really? Well, if I must... I'm sorry, everypony. I'm afraid I have to cut the party short. The mayor has requested an audience with me. Royal duty calls. Thank you for a wonderful time. It's been a joy getting to know you all better.
Phew! Now I can eat someth'n! I'm starved! Oh...
Stay right where you are. All I want is a clear path to the exit. NOBODY MOVE and my dress won't get hurt! Stay back! Back, I say!

Oh, you poor little thing. How did you ever get in such bad condition? Don't you worry, Philomena. I'll nurse you back to health. As a favor to the princess, who's obviously just far too busy to care for you properly.
This is far worse than I thought. What you need is some medicine. Stat!

Here you go, Philomena. This will fix you right up.
Doctor Fluttershy expected that.

There's nothing like homemade soup to cure what ails you. Come on now. You're not gonna get better if you don't cooperate. Mmm... See? It's delicious. Good and good for you. Here come the choo-choo train. Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo!
Oh dear. Don't worry, Philomena. I know what'll make you feel better. Wait right here. I have just the thing.

Look, Philomena. I brought a fellow feathered friend by to cheer you up. Hummingway here was sick once too, but he let me help him and got better in no time. Didn't you, boy?
Say hello to your new friend Philomena.

Oh... That's okay. I know lots of other ways to take care of you. Don't worry. You're gonna get better. How about...

Aromatherapy?

Warm bath?

Ointment?

Scalpel. Surgical tape. Feathers.
Oh, Philomena. I thought it would be easy to nurse you back to health. I've tried everything I know. And look at you. You're worse than ever.
I couldn't leave the poor thing there. She needed my help.
Oh no. NonononononoNO! This is bad.
How could I just walk away and not do anything?
But... but... she doesn't belong to you!
I had to do something.
Without telling anypony?! Without asking permission?!
But...
I know you had good intentions, but you have got to return Princess's pet!
But...
...go.

We were told we could find Twilight Sparkle here.
We regret to inform you, miss, that the royal pet has gone missing.
It's that dry night air?
But it's daytime.
Going to return Philomena, remember?
We can't now!
Why not?
You have no idea what the princess is gonna do if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?!
Do you?
Well... no. But it can't be anything good. She might banish you from Equestria. Or throw you in a dungeon. Or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon in the place that she banishes you to!
You really think the princess would do that?
Okay. Granted that probably won't happen, but do you wanna take any chances?
All that really matters to me is that poor little Philomena here gets well.
That's very noble of you. I'll write to you when you're banished. Unless I'm banished too somewhere there's no post office. Then you'll have to write to me. Deal?
Please, Twilight. You just have to help me get Philomena healthy and then we can return her to the Princess. And everything will be fine.
Did you give her any kind of medicine?
I tried to, but she wouldn't take it.
She can't fly.
No excuses!
Done. Okay, what else?
Uh... well, she keeps pulling her feathers off. The ones that haven't fallen out yet from all her coughing, I mean.
There you go.
I don't think she likes it.
Tough love, baby. You want her to get well, don't you?
Of course, but...
NEXT!
Well, she desperately needs some bed rest, but I can't get her to stay put.
One step ahead of you.

It's for your own good, Philomena, I promise. Please, just relax and try to get some sleep.
What's this soup over here? Smells delicious.
I made it for Philomena. But she wouldn't eat it.
Oh, she'll eat it, all right.
Hey! Where are you going?
No! Philomena! Come back!

What are you two doing? Are you having a race? Oh, can I play? One, two, three, GO!
Excuse me!
Hi!
Beg your pardon!
Put me down!
What in tarnation?!
Sorry, but we've gotta find...
The princess's pet bird!
Philomena, come down from there! You'll hurt yourself!
I'll catch you!
What is going on here? Twilight?
Yes, your Majesty, there's been a terrible accident.
It's all my fault.
No, Princess. Fluttershy didn't know any better. It was my fault.
I'm the one who did it.
But you were only trying to help.
Some help I was.
Will ya let me do this? She'll go easier on me.
But it's my fault!
No, it's my fault!
No, it's my fault! Wait, what are we talking about?
Thanks for trying to protect me, Twilight, but... Princess Celestia, I'm the one who took your pet bird. I really was only trying to help the poor little thing. Then I was gonna bring it right back to you, honest. So, if you wanna banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to, then that's what I deserve.
Oh, stop fooling around, Philomena. You're scaring everypony.
I don't understand! What is that thing? What happened to Philomena?
This is Philomena. She's quite a sight, as I said. But nothing unusual for a phoenix. Isn't that right, Philomena?
A... A phoenix?
So... aren't you gonna banish me? Or throw me in a dungeon? Or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to?
Of course not, my little pony. Where on Earth would you get such an idea?
I guess I have some imagination.
Fluttershy really did do everything she could to try to take care of Philomena for you.
And I do appreciate that your heart was in the right place, child. But all you had to do was ask me and I could have told you Philomena was a phoenix and saved you all this trouble.
I know. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. Next time I'll ask before taking matters into my own hooves.
Should I write you a letter about that lesson, Princess?
No, that's quite all right. I think I can remember.
It's beautiful. Thank you, Philomena. No hard feelings.


Neither have I, but Spike told me it was awesome!
Whoa!
Oh!
Wah!
Ow!
See anything?
Tree sap and pine needles, but no cutie mark.
Plan B?
Yeah. You know where we can find a cannon at this hour? It's no use! No matter what we try, we always end up without our cutie marks. And, surprisingly often, covered in tree sap.
Maybe we should do something less dangerous, like pillow testing or flower sniffing.
This town is full of ponies who have their cutie marks. Why don't we ask them how they did it?
That's a great safe idea.
Yeah! And we can start with the coolest pony in Ponyville.
Applejack!
Rarity!
Come on, guys, I said "cool"! You know who I'm talking about. She's fast. She's tough. She's not afraid of anything!
Pinkie Pie?
No! The greatest flyer ever to come out of Cloudsdale.
Fluttershy?
No! Rainbow Dash!
Oh! Yeah, that makes much more sense.
Of course!
Let's do it. Let's find out how Rainbow Dash earned her cutie mark!
YEAH!
Aah! Uuh!


Get back here, you thievin' varmints!
Thievin' what now?
Apple Bloom?
Hey sis! How'd you get your cutie mark?
I never told you that story?
Hey! I thought we were gonna ask Rainbow Dash.
We need all the help we can get.
Ugh. Fine.
Why, shoot. I was just a little filly. Even littler than y'all.

Hey! Outta the way, you rube!
Aunt Orange! Uncle Orange! Thank y'all so much for lettin' me stay!
Don't worry. We'll have you acting like a true Manehattanite in no time.

And how are you finding good old Manehattan?
Oh, it's simply divine.
Very well said, my dear.
Although, I must admit the city noise took some getting used to. Where I'm from, nights are so quiet you seldom hear a peep until the roosters wake you.
The... what?
I say, my dear, what in the world is a "rooster"?
Dinner is served.
Thank goodness. Being a city pony's hard work. I'm so hungry I could eat a...

Cock-a-doodle-doo... Oh, I wonder what Granny Smith and Big McIntosh are up to. I bet they're applebuckin' their way through the Red Delicious trees. Oh, what I wouldn't give for just one bite...

I've been happily workin' in the farm ever since.
There they are! Get back here, ya thievin' varmints!
Aw. That was such a sweet story!


All right, little ones. This way. This way. You really should be more careful. Somepony could get hurt. Why are you in such a hurry anyway?
We're trying to find Rainbow Dash, so we can hear how she earned her cutie mark.
Oh, that would be interesting. You know, I wouldn't have gotten my cutie mark if it weren't for her.
Rainbow Dash?! Really?!
Oh yes. It all started at Summer Flight Camp.

HA! My baby brother can fly better than you!
Leave her alone!
Ooh, what are you gonna do, "Rainbow Crash"?
Keep making fun of her and find out!
You think you're such a big shot? Why don't you prove it?
Whaddya have in mind?

You're going down!
In history, maybe. See you boys at the finish line!


What is this place
filled with so many wonders?
Casting its spell
That I am now under


Squirrels in the trees
and the cute little bunnies
Birds flying free
and bees with their honey


Hooooonneeeeeeey!


Oooh, what a magical place
and I owe it all to the Pegasus race
If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve 
I'd have come here sooner, and never leave


Yes, I love ev-er-ythiiiiing!

Shhh. It's okay. You can come out. Everything's okay. There's nothing to be afraid of.

Wait, wait, wait. What happened to Rainbow Dash? What about the race?
Oh. Well, I wasn't there, so I don't really know what happened.
Come on, Crusaders. We've gotta find her. Besides, I can't take any more singing.
Maybe my sister knows where she is. Bye, Fluttershy!
Bye, girls!

How did we get roped into this? Oh, we'll never hear Rainbow Dash's story.
Are you girls still obsessing over your cutie marks?
Of course! Most of the fillies at school already have theirs.
Mmm, I know how you feel. For the longest time I couldn't figure out why I didn't have mine.

Well done, Rarity. Your costumes are very nice.
Nice?! They need to be spectacular! And the performance is tomorrow!

Maybe I'm not meant to be a fashionista after all... Aah! What's going on?!

Ooh!


Ugh! These namby-pamby stories aren't getting us any closer to our cutie marks! They're all about finding who you really are and boring stuff like that.
Yes, Scootaloo, that's exactly...
Come on, girls! We need action! We need Rainbow Dash!

As a young filly in Canterlot, I always wanted to go to the Summer Sun Celebration, where Princess Celestia raises the sun.


Well, Miss Sparkle?

Well, Miss Sparkle?
We don't have all day.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Aah!
Twilight Sparkle.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...
You have a very special gift. I don't think I've ever come across a unicorn with your raw abilities.
Huh?
But you need to learn to tame these abilities through focused study.
Huh?!
Twilight Sparkle, I'd like to make you my own personal protégé here at the school.
HUH?!
Well?
YES!!!
One other thing, Twilight.
More? My cutie mark! Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes...

...yesyesyesyes...
Okay, okay.
We're happy for you, Twilight.
Yeah, thrilled. Let's get out of here while we still can.
...yesyes, YEEEES!
Are you okay?

Ugh! Why don't we ever smash into Rainbow Dash?!
You're looking for Rainbow Dash? If I was her, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner. Of course, if I was anyone, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner. Hey! I have an idea! Wanna go to Sugarcube Corner?
Well, we're sort of looking for Rainbow Dash, so we can hear how she got her cutie mark.
Cutie mark? Come with me and I'll tell you how I got mine!
Alright!

We better harvest the rocks from the south field.
Pinkamena Diane Pie! Is that you?
Mom! I need you and dad and the sisters to come in. Quick!
Surprise! You like it? It's called... a party!

And that's how Equestria was made!
Wha... huh?
Look! We're here!
Maybe on the way home I can tell you the story of how I got my cutie mark. It's a gem!
Oh, come on. She's just being Pinkie Pie.
Ugh...

Rainbow Dash! You're here!
I hear you're looking for my cutie mark story.
It all happened during the race at Flight Camp...

Ow!
Ha! Later, Rainbow Crash!
Hey!

And that, little ones, is how you earn a cutie mark.
Whooooaaaa...
Wait a second. I heard that explosion. And I saw the rainbow too. Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't scared the animals, I never would have learned I could communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark.
I heard that boom! And right afterwards, there was this amazing rainbow that taught me to smile.
When I got my cutie mark, I saw a rainbow that pointed me home. I bet it was your sonic rainboom!
There was an explosion I could never explain when I got my cutie mark.
This is uncanny! If that explosion didn't happen when it did, I would have blown my entrance exam. Rainbow Dash, I think you helped me earn my cutie mark too!
Whoa!
We all owe our cutie marks to you!
Do you realize what this means? All of us had a special connection before we even met.
We've been BFFs forever and we didn't even know it!
Come here, y'all.
AWWW!!!
I'm so glad we're friends!
I love you, guys!
Awwww...
Hey. How about a song?
NO!!!!!

Dear Princess Celestia,
Today I learned something amazing. Everypony everywhere has a special magical connection with her friends, maybe even before she's met them. If you're feeling lonely and you're still searching for your true friends, just look up in the sky. Who knows? Maybe you and your future best friends are all looking at the same rainbow.
Gross! When did you get so cheesy?
Just write it, Spike.


This meteor shower tonight's gonna be amazing!
Awesome!
You know, this shower only happens once every 100 years.
A centennial celebration!
We better get a move on!
Spike, did you grab my quill and ink?
Check!
Scrolls?
Check! I've also packed a telescope, apples, bananas, fruit punch, and my freshly baked homemade triple-decker nut-crazy vanilla cream cookies!
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.
That is why you are my number one assistant.
Missed that! Huh...?
The Astronomo-lomo homono what?
You know that really old big blue book on stars, moons, planets, the universe...?
Hey! What's taking my number one assistant so long?


I was sure I put the astronomer's guide back. The book would have helped me identify different planets and stars tonight.
Well... Maybe someone borrowed it? Besides, you don't need that book. You can already name all the planets and stars, 'cause you're super smart and astronomically awesome!
Thanks, Spike. You're such a flatterer.
Yeah, I'm a sweet talker.
And a number one assistant, right?
Check!
Ooh! Ooh! Me! Me! Me! I'll do whatever you want, Rainbow Dash!
Oh yeah, pipsqueak? How about taking out the trash?
Yes ma'am!
Do we have Spike to thank again for this amazing spread? Isn't he simply amazing?
Little Spikey-wikey! Who knew that big ferocious dragon started off so cutesy wootsy?
Spike, you are such a little star that I had to make a little bow tie for you.
Spike, that's enough.
Oh, right. That's enough.
Hey, everypony! The show is starting!
Wow...

Mmm. Wow! These cookies are delish!
Spike made them. Speaking of, Spike, can you bring us some punch? Spike?
Oh, poor little thing.
Aww... He's worked himself to the bone.
And now the punch has been... "spiked"!

Huh.
"...have body structures that are fragile and diverse..."
Shoot! Oh... This is a job for Spike. If only he were awake...
Hoo!
Wait! Don't go! Don't be afraid. Thank you for returning my scroll.
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo-hoo.
Gosh, it's cold tonight. Say, would you like to relax in here and keep me company while I work?
Hoo! Hoo!
Now, where was I? Oh, yes. "...fragile and diverse with a surrounding cloud of material called a coma, that grows in size and brightness as the comet approaches the sun..."

Spike, don't worry.
But my morning chores...
It's okay. Owlowiscious did them for you.
Who?
He's our new junior assistant. He's gonna help out with your chores so you won't be so tired all the time.
Wha... Wh... What do we need a junior assistant for? I'm not tired. I do fine on my own. I don't need sleep, I...
Spike, don't worry. He's just here to help out a little. Now, I have to go out, so why don't you introduce yourself to Owlowiscious? He's in the library.
Worried? Do I look worried? I'm not worried. Who's worried?
Hello? Hellooo! Whoa! Dude, that's creepy. Uh... Hi there! I'm Spike. I'm sure Twilight has told you all about me.
Hoo.
Uh, Spike? You know, assistant number one?
Hoo?
I'm Spike! And who are you? What are you?
Hoo!
Who?
Hoo!
I thought your name was Owlowiscious!
Hoo?
Okay, "Who", "Owlowiscious", whatever. I'm Spike, okay? Look! All you need to know is that I'm number one and you're number two. Got it?
Hoo?
That bird is out for my job. He wants to be number one. I'll prove to Twilight that I deserve to be number one. Not Freaky Feathers over there. I won't let him have my job if it's the last thing I do!

Oh, what a fantastical, flufflicious feathery little friend! I'm... HOOked!
He's just wonderful.
And Owlowiscious is just such a star I just had to make this little bow for you.
Grrr!
What's he all saddle sore about?
He's probably just jealous of Owlowiscious.
Maybe Spike feels threatened or worried that Owlowiscious will replace him?
Replace him? Hah! That's crazy! Spike knows he can't be replaced.

They're trying to replace me! I better step it up and make sure that Twilight and Owlowiscious know that I'm still number one!
Hey, Spike! Can you fetch me that book called "Two-headed Myth...
...Mythological Mysteries!" I know where it is.
Thanks, Owlowiscious. Hey, Spike, no worries. Owlowiscious flew up and got the book for me. Oh, and gee! I guess I need "Ferrets of Fairyland" too.
Hey! Whoa! Whoa!
Climb down from there before you fall.
Grrr!

Shoot!
Yes, sir!
My last writing quill. It's broken.
Hoo.
Where am I gonna get a quill?
Spike, wait! Wait!

But the store is called "Quills and Sofas". You only sell two things!
Sorry, Junior. All outta quills until Monday. Need a sofa?

I swore I had one here somewhere. Ah, here it is! A quince!
Not a quince. A quill!
Nope. Sorry. All outta quills.


Oh, Spike. I was calling out for you when you were turning this place upside down. Owlowiscious gave me one of his feathers to use as a quill.
That's just great. Perfect! Sweet! I think I'll just, uh... finish up the rest of my chores! Or did Owlowiscious already do them?
Oh, no no. There are quite a lot of them.
Poor Spike. He'll come around. He's genuinely a good little guy.

Huh?
Spike. What is this? You said this book was missing. Well, Owlowiscious found it right where it belongs, but like this. How did it get this way?
Uh... Well, um... You see, I... I just didn't wanna disappoint you and, uh... Have you ever seen a dragon sneeze?
I've seen a dragon lie. I'm very disappointed in you, Spike.
Hoo!
Not "who"! Two! Urgh!

Owlowiscious is out to take my place, I just know it! I've gotta stop him. But how?
Ah... Muahahaha!

Come along, Opal. Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party.
So lifelike. And when Twilight discovers it shredded up on her floor, she'll think mouse-eating Owlowiscious is to blame. And I'll be number one... again! Muhahaha!

That poor little field mouse! Torn to pieces! It must have been Owlowiscious! You know, since owls eat, you know, mice. What a terrible, terrible bird! He must be punished! Right?
Spike! I don't know what upsets me more. That you deliberately tried to set up Owlowiscious or that you actually thought this pathetic attempt would work! You've let your jealousy get the best of you, Spike. I am truly disappointed. This is NOT the Spike I know and love.
She... She doesn't love me anymore.

Twilight hates me. I'm cold, hungry, tired and lonely. Could it get any worse?
I guess that's a yes.
Hello? Hello?
What is that?
If this is what running away is all about, I never wanna go home! Gems! Mmm... Woohoo!

What are you doing in my cave? And why are you eating my gems?
Heyah bro! I didn't know this was your cave. And I didn't know these were your gems, but... we're cool, right?
Whoa, whoa! Hey... We're like brothers, you know? I mean, you're a dragon, I'm a dragon... It's us against the world, right?
You don't scare me! So you're big.
Really big. And your claws are super sharp. Tail... extra spiky. But, uh... You don't scare me! Ha! How'd you like that? Uh... I'd love to stay, but gotta go! See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya! Aah!
Hoo-hoo!
Spike! Over here!
Am I glad to see you!
Hurry! Hop on! It's too dark! I can't see!
Hoo! Hoo-hoo!

I thought you didn't need me anymore. And that you didn't love me anymore.
Spike. Sure, I was disappointed, but you are my number one assistant! And friend. And you always will be. It's just that sometimes I need some help at night. I can't ask you to stay up late. You're a baby dragon and you need your rest. Owls are nocturnal. So I asked Owlowiscious to help. But not to take your place. No one could ever replace you, Spike. Not even when you are being a jealous numbskull.
I'm sorry, Twilight. I've never should have been so jealous.
And I'm sorry too, Spike. I should have been more sensitive.
And Owlowiscious... I know now that you weren't out to take my job. Forgive me?
Hoo?
Me. Forgive me, Spike.
Hoo!
Hey! How did you guys know where I was?
It was your ketchup-covered feet. Owlowiscious discovered your footprints and we followed them all the way to the cave.

I know Princess Celestia will wanna read about what happened today...
I'm ready when you are.
Hey, Spike. Why don't you write to Princess Celestia? And tell her what you've learned?
Really? Why, that's a big responsibility!
I know. But nothing my number one assistant can't handle.
Dear Princess Celestia,
Oh, Spike.
Hoo?


Oh! Hi, Pinkie Pie...

This is your singing telegram
I hope it finds you well
You're invited to a party
'Cause we think you're really swell


Gummy's turning one year old
So help us celebrate
The cake will be delicious
The festivities first-rate


There will be games and dancing
And when the party's over
We'll gather 'round for a group hug


No need to bring a gift
Being there will be enough
Birthdays mean having fun with friends
Not getting lots of stuff


It won't be the same without you
So we hope that you say yes
So, please, oh please R.S.V.P.
And come, and be our guest!



Nice one! Now, let me show you how it's really done.
Hey, girls!
Hey, Pinkie Pie!
Howdy!
Are you kiddin'? I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Me neither. When Pinkie Pie throws a party, I am there! Ta-da!
Aw! It's just a boring old apple. Don't worry, there are plenty of other surprises in there.
I can't tell you that, silly. Then it wouldn't be a surprise.

This punch is simply divine. Is this the same recipe you used for your "Spring Has Sprung" party?
Nope! Something new.
It's Gummy's favorite.
Ooh, this is my jam!

Having fun?
A blast!
You always throw the best parties, Pinkie Pie.
They're always the best parties 'cause my best friends are always there!
Yah!
C'mon, everypony! Gummy wants to dance! Go, Gummy! It's your birthday! Go, Gummy! It's your birthday!

Hoo-wee! I am beat! I haven't danced that much since... Well, since your last party. Thanks again for the invite!
See ya later, birthday alligator!
Bravo for hosting yet another delightful soiree.
It's been lovely.
You sure you don't wanna stay? There's still some cake left.
Uh, I think I'm gonna pass. Great party though. We should do this again soon.

Oh! Hi, Pinki-
It's soon!
Pardon me?
You said we should have another party soon, and... it's soon! Here's your invitation!
"You're invited to Gummy's 'after-birthday' party. This afternoon at 3 o'clock."
All our bestest friends are invited, and there's gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!
This afternoon? As in, "this afternoon" this afternoon?
Yes, indeedy!
Oh, gosh. I wish I could make it, but I've gotten a bit behind in my studies. I've really gotta hit the books.
I understand. Your studies come first. But don't worry, we'll be sure to save you some cake.
Please do.
Oh! And Twilight, you shouldn't hit the books. You should really just read them.
I'll keep that in mind.

Huh? Oh, hi, Pinkie Pie! What brings you 'round these parts?
Who's ready to shake their hoof-thang?! It's an invitation to Gummy's "after-birthday" party this afternoon. There's gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!
This afternoon? A-as in, "this afternoon" this afternoon?
That's funny. That's just what Twilight said, and the answer is, "Yes! It's this afternoon!"
Okey-dokey-lokey! A party is still a party, even if there are only three guests.

Ooh! Love the new hat. Very modern. What's the occasion?
Gummy's "after-birthday" party is this afternoon. I'm delivering the invitations.
The party is this afternoon? As in, "this afternoon" this afternoon?
It's so strange. Everypony keeps saying that.
Oh... do they?
I know it's short notice, but we had such a great time at his birthday party, I thought we could have even more fun at his after-birthday party.
And I'm sure that we would, but I'm going to have to decline. I have to... wash my hair!
Don't be silly, your hair doesn't look dirty.
It doesn't?
Nope!
Huh... No Twilight, no Applejack, no Rarity. Oh well, a party is still a party even with only two guests.

This afternoon?
As in...?
Yes! As in, "this afternoon" this afternoon!
Oh, man! We'd love to, but... we're... house-sitting this afternoon.
It's... uh... a big house.
Uh, look at the time! We'd really better get going.
Wait! Maybe I could bring you some after-birthday cake and ice-cream. Who're you house-sitting for?
Harry.
Harry?
Yeah, I don't think you know him.
That's strange. I know just about everypony around here.
He's... a bear.
A bear?
Yup! He's a bear all right, and he'll be pretty upset if we don't get over to his house soon.
Wait! There's a bear around here who lives in a house?
It's, uh, really more of a cave.
But he's fixed up the place so much, it feels like a house.
And, uh, he wants us to look after his house... uh, cave... while he's, uh...
A-at the beach!
He's vacationing at the beach?
Yup! He loves to...
Gotta go!

That doesn't look like studying... or hitting!

Ooh! You must be here for...
Shh! Is Pinkie Pie around?
Oh, I don't think so.
Good. I don't wanna her to know anything about this.
Yes, of course. I'll be right back.
There you go.

She didn't see you at the sweet shop, did she?
I don't think so.
Oh, good. I'd hate for her to ruin everything.
Me too.
Have you seen her?
Not since this morning.
Me neither. Can you believe she was planning on throwing an after-birthday party today?
I'm just glad I was able to come up with an excuse for why I couldn't be there.
Me too! This is obviously going to be so much better.
As long as we keep her from finding out about it, it will.
I thought everypony loved my parties.
Hi, Pinkie Pie! Uh-oh!
Rainbow Dash! Wait!
Phew...
Where're you going?!
Ah!
What's the real reason you didn't want to come to Gummy's party?!
What's in those bags?!
Applejack! We have a problem!
I know you're IN THERE!
Oh! Howdy, pardner!
Mind if I... take a look inside the barn?
No! Uh, I mean, yes, I mean... you can't come in here!
Rainbow Dash just went in there.
Oh, well, she was just bringin' in some... supplies! Yup, supplies for the... renovation! Fixin' up the whole thing, top to bottom... uh, lots of construction goin' on in there right now.
Okey... dokey... lokey.

Secrets and lies! It's all secrets and lies with those ponies! They're up to something, Gummy! Something they don't want me to know about! Well, I'm gonna know about it! I'm gonna know about it big time! And I know just who's gonna tell me all about it. Tell me all about it BIG TIME!

Wow! Nice spread!
It's all yours, Spike. All you have to do is talk.
That's it? Oh, you got it. Okay... uh, beautiful weather we're having, eh? I love a sunny spring day, don't you? The birds chirpin' and the flowers bloomin'.
No, no, no. Talk about our friends.
Oh, okay. Let's see, there's Twilight Sparkle. She's a unicorn. Good with magic. A real brainiac. And then you got Rarity. Total knock-out. Twilight seems to think I don't even have a chance with her, but... eh, what does she know? Let's see. There's... there's Fluttershy, a Pegasus who's afraid of heights. Heh, what's up with that?
Grr! No! You're not understanding me! I want you to confess!
Confess?
Confess!
I'm the one who spilled juice all over Twilight's copy of "Magical Mysteries and Practical Potions"!
And?
And I'm the one who used up all the hot water in Ponyville yesterday when I took a seven-hour bubble bath!
Aaand?
Lookin' good, Spike! Lookin' real good!
No! No! No! NO!
W-What do you wanna hear? Tell me what you want me to say, and I'll say it!
Your friends are all lying to you and avoiding you 'cause they don't like your parties and they don't want to be your friends anymore!

Thank you all so much for coming! It means so much to Gummy.
Could I have some more punch?
This is one great pahty! You really outdone yourself!
Why, thank you, Rocky.
I'm having a delightful time as well.
Might I trouble you for anozer slice of cake?
Anything for you, Madame le Flour.
Oh, they're not so bad.
Not so bad? Puh-lease! They're a buncha losers!
Oh, c'mon now. "Losers" might be a little strong, dont'cha think?
After the way they treated you? I say "losers" isn't strong enough.
Well, it was pretty rude...
Pretty rude? It was downright deespicable!
It was, wasn't it?
If I were you, I wouldn't speak to them ever again.
Such losers!
Yes, zat's right.
Who could that be?
Hey there, Pinkie Pie! Sorry I was in such a rush earlier. Had some place to be and couldn't slow down and say, "Hello." You know how it goes.
I know how it goes, all right!
Yeah... so, why don't you come with me over to Sweet Apple Acres?
No thanks. I'm spending time with my real friends. Isn't that right, Madame le Flour?
Uh... Pinkie Pie?
Another slice of cake, Sir Lintsalot?
Aaallrighty. What do you say we get on out of Creepytown and head over to Applejack's...
I most certainly am not. I'm having a wonderful time right here.
You should really just come with me.
Who you calling a chump, chump?! Ugh... That's it. Party's over. Come on, Pinkie Pie!
No!
Pinkie Pie, let's go!
I said NO!
No... I... DON'T!
Oh, you wanna do this the hard way?! We'll do this the hard way!

I really thought she'd be more excited.
Excited? EXCITED? Why would I be excited to attend my own farewell party?!
Farewell party?
Yes! You don't like me anymore, so you decided to kick me out of the group and throw a great, big party to celebrate! A "Farewell to Pinkie Pie" party!
Why in the world would you think we didn't like you anymore, sugarcube?
Why? Why? WHY?! Because you've been lying to me and avoiding me all day, that's why!
Uh, yeah! Because we wanted your party to be a surprise.
We'd been planning this party for such a long time, we had to make excuses for why we couldn't attend Gummy's party so that we could get everything ready for yours.
If this is a farewell party, why does the cake I picked up from Sugarcube Corner say "Happy Birthday, Pinkie Pie"?
And you like me so much you decided to throw me a surprise party!
That's what we've been trying to tell you, darling.
You girls are the best friends ever! How could I have ever doubted you?
It's okay, Pinkie Pie. It could have happened to any of us.
Uh-huh! It sure would.
Don't worry about it.
I'm just glad I haven't been replaced by a bucket of turnips.
Huh?
You don't wanna know.
All right, girls! Enough of this gab. Let's party!

Dear Princess Celestia,
I am writing to you from the most delightful party. I'm not only having a great time with my friends, but also was given the opportunity to learn a valuable lesson about friendship. Always expect the best from your friends, and never assume the worst. Rest assured that a good friend always has your best interests at heart.

Your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle

You girls wouldn't mind if we celebrated Gummy's after-birthday party too, would you? His party was cut short, and he's pretty upset about it.
Oh, definitely.
Aww, he was upset?
Uh-huh, sure!
For Gummy, yeah!


Ahh! I... can't... believe... the Grand... Galloping... Gala... is... tonight!
Pinkie! Please stop shouting, I'm trying to concentrate.
Pinkie Pie! Stop that right now. It's time to prepare for the Gala, and I refuse to let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty.
What's Twilight doing?
She's got an awesome magic spell she's been working on for the Gala.
Where are the others? It's getting late.
Hold your horses, girl. We're here.
Perfect! I'm ready.
For what?
All right, Spike.
An apple! Are we having pie?
Shh! Watch!
Thanks. But that's just the start. Fluttershy, did you bring your friends?
Yes. Will they be safe, Twilight?
You have my word.
Ta-da!
Neat, huh? And don't worry. They'll be mice again at midnight.
Opalescence, no!
Wait! Come back! Those horses were supposed to pull our carriage. How will we get to the Gala?
What ever shall we do?
Uh... ahem. Excuse me. Uh, would you boys mind pulling our carriage to the Gala?

Oh. Yeah. Right.


Ooh!
Come on, you guys. Let me in!
Sure thing, Spike.
Heavens no! We're getting dressed.
Dressed? Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh... we don't normally wear clothes.
I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight. Our home town, Twilight! And the best part is that we all get to hang out together all night long!
Uh... I-I don't know, Spike.
We'll just have to see.
We're gonna be a mite busy.
Oh. Okay.
Don't worry, Spike. We'll all get to spend some time together.
Great!

'Cause I planned out my insider's tour of Canterlot. I've gotta show Rarity the crown jewels, and Applejack the Princess's golden apple tree. And Pinkie, we gotta go to my favorite donut shop.
Then let's get moving! Hyah!
Excuse me!?
Um... I...
If you weren't friends with our neighbor Rarity... Hmph.

Whoa! You all look... amazing!

I can't believe we're finally here. With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this... The Best Night Ever!

Yeah! This is gonna be the best night ever. You know why? Cause we're all gonna spend time at the Gala to... gether. Or not.

Princess Celestia!
Twilight! It is so lovely to see my star student.
Oh, I'm so excited to be here! We have so much to catch up on.
Well, I want you right by my side the entire evening, so we'll have plenty of time together.
That's just what I was hoping you'd say.


Oh my! A meadowlark!

Howdy, partner! You hungry?
As a horse!
Well, what'cha hankering for? Caramel apple? Apple pie? Apple fritter? Apple fries?
I'll take that big apple pie!
Well, thank you kindly, sir! Yee-haw! In the first minute, I made my first sale. Just like I expected.

Always hungry after a show. Eh, Soarin?
Hey, no prob.
Hey! I know you. You're the pony that saved us in Cloudsdale and won The Best Flyer Competition.
Hay yeah! Name's Rainbow Dash.
Well, Rainbow Dash. Looks like your skills saved us again. Oh, well, at least they saved Soarin's apple pie.
Wanna come hang out with us?


I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala,
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala,
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala,
It's all I ever dreamed.


It's all I ever dreamed, woo hoo!
It's all I ever dreamed, yippee!
I'm at the Grand Galloping GalaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAA!


It's all I've ever... dreamed?


Well, hello. I am Prince Blueblood.
I am... Rarity. Oh my, what a lovely rose.
You mean... this rose? Thank you. It goes with my eyes.

Was that you?
Oh! Yes... Well... Excuse me.
Oh! I see a toco toucan! And a spider monkey! And, oh! Is that a wallaroo? Oh, Fluttershy. You're such a loudmouth.


Welcome to the Grand Galloping Gala.
Princess! I've been so excited to spend time with you and...
Yes. Me too, Twi... Oh, good evening! Welcome to the Gala. Which is why I... Ladies! Lovely to see you again.


I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala... and it's not what I dreamed.

This isn't at all what I imagined.

This isn't what I hoped.

This isn't hanging out.

This isn't what I wished for.

No!
I waited all my life...
...for this moment!
And I'm not going to...
...let it slip by!
If it's the last thing I do...
...I'm gonna make this...
...the best night ever!

Gotcha! It's okay. I promise not to hurt you. I just wanna be your... friend?
Mmm... Sounds good to me.


Just give him a chance, Rarity. His princely side is sure to come out if you're just patient.
Miss Rarity! Stop!
Oh. Prince Blueblood! How chivalrous.
One would hate to slip.
Yes. One certainly would.
One's cloak should take care of the problem.
Oh, of course it will.

C'mon, everypony! I know what will make you shake those groove-thangs!

You reach your right hoof in
You reach your right hoof out
You reach your right hoof in
And you shake it all about
You do the Pony Pokey meeting lots of folks with clout
That's what I'm talking about


You step your left hoof in
You pull it right back out
You step your left hoof in
But you better help him out
You do the Pony Pokey but should find a different route
That's what it's all about


You kick your back left in
You pull your back left out
You reach your back left in
Just be brave and have no doubt
You do the Pony Pokey feeling like you're gonna pout
That's what I'm singing about


You tilt your head in
You tilt your head out
You tilt your head in
Then you shake it all about
You do the Pony Pokey even though your date's a lout
You're better off without


You stomp your whole self in
You stomp your whole self out
You stomp your whole self in
And you stomp yourself about
You do the Pony Pokey and you give a little shout-


COME OUT!

That's what I'm talking about


You do the Pony Pokey
You do the Pony Pokey
You do the Pony Pokey
And that's what it's all about


Yeah!

Young lady, this is not that kind of party.
Ohhhhhh... They don't want a party. These ponies want a paaartay!

Two apple fritters, please.
Two apple fritters comin' right up. That'll be four bits.
Ahem.
Ahem.
Ahem!
AHEM!
It's okay, Rarity. I got you covered.
Thank you, Applejack. At least somepony here has good manners.
Well, no wonder nopony wants my food. They're fillin' up on those fancy-schmancy vittles. Well, my down-home apples are plenty good enough for this crowd. I'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em.


Come on, everypony! You wanted a partay? Now it's paaartaaay! Yeah! Uh! Now that's a beat, yeah! Uh! C'mon, dance! Yeah, woohoo!
Okay, all you high-class ponies. Here's a highfalutin apple cake for your hoity-toity taste buds.
STAGE DIVE!
Ewww...! Uh, stay back! I just had myself groomed!
This is my chance! Yes! Whoa!
Well... it can't get any worse.
You're... going to LOVE ME!
Um, um, uh... Eugh.
Run.

Ooh! Rarity, your glass slipper! Now your prince is sure to find you.

Hey, Pony Joe. Another donut.
Don't you think you've had enough?
Another donut! Extra sprinkles!
Twilight Sparkle! Ha, ha. Long time no see.
Hey, how was the Gala? How was your best night ever?

That sounds like the worst night ever!
I just hope Princess Celestia isn't upset with us for ruining the Gala.
That was the best Grand Galloping Gala ever!
Princess Celestia?!
Pardon me, Princess, but tonight was just awful.
Oh, Twilight. The Grand Galloping Gala is always awful.
It is?
That is why I was thrilled you were all attending. I was hoping you could liven things up a bit. And while the evening may not have gone as you planned, I'm sure you'll agree that in the end it didn't turn out so bad for this group of friends.
You're right, Princess. Friends have a way of making even the worst of times into something pretty great.
Yeah! Hanging out with friends!
Talking!
Laughing!
You mean doing exactly what I wanted to do the whole time?
Yes, Spike. You were right.
As horrible as our night was...
...being together here has made it all better.
In fact, it's made it...
